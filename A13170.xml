            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:18556:3"/> The ſame we likewiſe find verified in your Maieſties predeceſſor Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of glorious memorie. At her firſt coming to the Crowne, ſhe brake downe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and molten Images, ſhe tooke downe high altars, and remoued away all monuments of ſuperſtition out of the Church: ſhe feared not the malignitie of men, but claue to the Lord, reſoluing to keepe his holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and to ſee God worſhipped according to the preſcript rule of his ſacred word. She was all her life long a harbor to the diſtreſſed children of God, a refuge to the oppreſſed, a protector of the perſecuted for the teſtimonie of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> &amp; a nurſing mother of Gods Church. Therefore God maruellouſly protected her, both againſt the force of forreine enemies, and alſo againſt the conſpiracies of domeſticall traitors, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to proſper in all her affaires. She liued &amp; raigned long and happily, and dying left behind her a ſweet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of many bleſſings by her meanes beſtowed vpon her people.</p>
            <p>Contrariwiſe, ſuch as either know not, or did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from whence they receiued their kingly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, but either neglected the worſhip of God, or elſe for Gods worſhip eſtabliſhed ſuperſtition and idolatrie in the Church, haue ſeldome long raigned, or proſpered in their kingdomes. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> forgetting what great fauor God had done him, aduancing him from low eſtate to the kingdome, and renting it from the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to giue it vnto him, receiued a threatning meſſage from the Lord by the hand of the Prophet <hi>Ahijah,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 14. The ſame alſo was ſhortly after accompliſhed. For <hi>God brought euill vpon the houſe of Ieroboam,</hi> and cut off his poſteritie, becauſe he did euill in the ſight of the Lord, and erected idolatrie at <hi>Bethel.</hi> Likewiſe Queene <hi>Mary,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18556:3"/> who brought this land not onely vnder the commaund of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> but alſo vnder the heauie yoke of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> burdenſome both to mens ciuill eſtates, and alſo to their conſciences, &amp; erected ſuperſtition and idolatrie, which before had bene baniſhed, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Saints of God that would not bow their knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> had a ſhort, troubleſome and vnhappie raigne, and left behind her nothing but hatred for her crueltie, and infamy for her vnnaturall dealing with her ſubiects, and miſgouernement.</p>

I haue alſo wiped away both his malicious imputations, &amp; encountred him in his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling inuectiues, defending the honor of our dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, whoſe memorie ſhall neuer die in the minds
<pb facs="tcp:18556:4"/> of her louing ſubiects, and anſwering for true religion calumniated by the ſlanderous tongues of the ſuppoſts and ſlaues of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſcourſe, although not of that perfection that it may ſeeme worthy to be preſented to ſo great a King, yet for that it containeth a defence of your Maieſties predeceſſor, which you honour, and of that religion which you profeſſe; I am bold to conſecrate to your Maieſtie, as the firſt fruites of my loyall affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. Therin alſo your Maieſtie may ſee, not only a precedent to follow, but alſo a reward propoſed to thoſe, that ſtudiouſly and couragiouſly ſeeke to aduance pietie and true religion.</p>
            <p>The aduerſarie by all meanes ſeeketh to ſuppreſſe truth, and to aduance idolatrie and popiſh errors, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruing things well done, imputing crimes to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, excuſing offenders, denying things manifeſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and deuiſing matters neuer done, nor imagined. But while he hath ſought to bring diſgrace, not onely vpon true religion, but alſo vpon the reſtorers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders thereof, he hath giuen vs iuſt occaſion to ſhew that the doctrine, religion and practiſe of Papiſts, is not only repugnant to truth, but alſo enemie to Princes and States, grieuous to Chriſtians, and profitable to none, but to the ſlaues and adherents of Antichriſt. Further, I haue made it apparant, that the ſtate of popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is no way to be maintained, but by trecherie and maſſacres, by lying, railing and forgerie, being hatefull both to God and man, and the cauſe of many miſeries and calamities.</p>
            <p>Vouchſafe therefore, moſt worthy and noble King, to reade this diſcourſe enſuing. It ſhal declare vnto your Maieſtie plainely, by what meanes you may eſtabliſh
<pb facs="tcp:18556:4"/> your eſtate. Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in her latter dayes was made beleeue, that remiſſe dealing in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would aſſure her life, often ſought for by Papiſts; and her State, that they by all meanes haue ſought to ouerthrow. But this her remiſneſſe gaue her enemies oportunitie to practiſe againſt her life, and to make a ſtrong partie againſt Religion and the State, as your Maieſtie very well knoweth. For the ſame is lately bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, to the hazard of your royall perſon, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering of the State: and God knoweth whether thoſe that haue intended miſchiefe againſt your royall Maieſtie, that neuer offended them, did not worke miſchiefe againſt her, whom they tooke to be the obſtacle of all their plots and deſſeines.</p>
            <p>Your Maieſtie, I doubt not, will wiſely conſider of theſe plotters, and their abettors, and all their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.<note place="margin">Prouerb. 20.</note>

In the yeare 1588. they prouided againſt <hi>England,</hi> not onely great land-forces, but alſo a great fleete, in their owne conceit inuincible, yet by Gods grace eaſily vanquiſhed and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Likewiſe <hi>anno 1597</hi> and <hi>1598.</hi> they made two attempts, or rather offers, of ſome enterpriſe againſt the State. In the firſt one <hi>D. Stillington</hi> and other Maſſe-prieſts Engliſh and Spaniſh miſcaried, the Spaniſh fleete being wracked on the rockes of their owne country, ſo that they could not come to ſing Maſſe in <hi>England.</hi> The other was diſappointed by ſtormes and contrary winds, ſo that no effect came of it.</p>
            <p>The noiſe of theſe preparations and menaces comming into <hi>England,</hi> and being bruited abroade, partly by letters, and partly by a proud proclamation ſet forth in print by the <hi>Adelantado</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> wherein he plainly diſcouereth, that
<pb facs="tcp:18556:6"/> he meant no leſſe then to cut all our throates if he could: it is no maruell if the State, and diuers men well affected to their countrey, did prepare themſelues to make reſiſtance. Among the rest Sir <hi>Francis Haſtings,</hi> a man of auncient nobilitie, and one that hath adorned the honour of his parentage with excellent vertues, and namely with true pietie, loue of his countrey, fortitude and magnanimitie, ſcorning to heare, that ſo baſe a rabble of <hi>Marranes</hi> and <hi>Biſognos</hi> as were aſſembled firſt at <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and then at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> ſhould either talke or thinke of the conqueſt of <hi>England,</hi> which the <hi>Adelantado</hi> in his bragging <hi>Rodomonts</hi> ſtile did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he armeth himſelfe, and prepareth his friends and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen to make reſiſtance. Perceiuing alſo the ſecuritie of ſome, and ſlackneſſe of others, eſpecially ſuch as were tainted with the peſtilent infection of Italian atheiſme, or Spaniſh Marraniſme, but commonly titled Cacolike or popiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; he publiſheth a little treatiſe, called <hi>A watch-word,</hi> giuing warning to the ſecure, and ſtirring vp ſuch as ſeemed euill affected, to reſiſt manfully, and to withſtand the Spaniſh incrochments and pretences.</p>
            <p>This booke croſsing the deſſeines of <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> and his conſorts, who by all meanes ſought to ſet <hi>England</hi> in combustion, that they might triumph in the aſhes, and ſing Maſſe in the funerals of their natiue countrey; we may perceiue by the ſequele, that it touched his cauſe and faction very nearely, and therefore was taken by him very tenderly. For preſently he taketh pen in hand, and writeth a most ſcornefull and bitter treatiſe against her Maieſties procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, againſt Religion and all that profeſſe it, railing againſt Sir <hi>Francis</hi> and the profeſſors of the truth, and commending in the beſt ſort he could, both the profeſſed enemies, and the ſecret vnderminers of the State. Wherein, if we would but note the mans ſingular impudencie, or rather his audacious
<pb facs="tcp:18556:6"/> foolerie, it were argument ſufficient to confound all his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. For at what time the <hi>Spaniard</hi> lay with forces at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> and by a Proclamation ſet forth in print, threatned fire and ſword againſt the Realme; <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> like a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous traitor, in his <hi>Ward-word</hi> talketh of nothing but peace, and would make vs beleeue, that both the Pope and Spaniards are our good friends. Where Ieſuites, and Maſſe-prieſts, and malcontent Papiſts were brewing of ſedition, and preparing themſelues to ioyne with forreine forces: this good fellow would make vs beleeue, that traitors are good friends, and that there was no hurt by them meant to the Queene or State. Finally, this babling <hi>Warder</hi> doth addreſſe all his diſcourſe to the Lords of the Councell, and chiefe dealers in matters of State; albeit the ſame tended wholly to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the State.</p>
            <p>And yet when I conſider the practiſes of the enemies of the State, I muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that he had great reaſon to enter into this ſhameleſſe courſe. For albeit there was no colour of truth in his diſcourſe, yet he ſuppoſed, if the ſame were ſhewed to her Maieſtie, that it would make her ſtay her preparatiues. He thought alſo, it would proue a faire pretence to thoſe that were loth to ſpend their money, to forbeare to make reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemy. Further, he ſaw that the ſame would bleare mens eyes, while both forreine enemies and ſecret traitors ſought to cut our throates. And finally, the ſame being full of railing, ſcorning and ſcurrilitie, he doubted not but the ſame would deterre others, or at leaſt make them ſlow to take vpon them the defence of the common cauſe. For what man conſidering the ſmal encouragement that forward men did find at the hands of friends, and the rude entertainment they receiue at the hands of enemies, would not leaue the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of the State to thoſe, that haue moſt intereſt in publike gouernement?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18556:7"/>
            <p>All this notwithſtanding, ſir <hi>Francis</hi> conſidering the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that Chriſtians haue to maintaine ſincere religion, &amp; that bindeth true harted ſubiects to defend their country, hath publiſhed an Apologie, both in defence of the common cauſe, and of his owne reputation, againſt the ſcurrilous and railing libell, which <hi>Parſons</hi> calleth <hi>A warde-word:</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, no doubt, reward at the hands of God, rather then ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and reſpecting rather his own dutie then the praiſe of others. But before either the booke came forth, or that I knew the Knights reſolution, the impudencie of the man ſo boldly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling traitors and forreine enemies, together with his ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar arrogancy deſpiſing his own nation, and his fooliſh ſpeakes for the Popes cauſe ſtollen out of others, and put forth as his wont is, in his owne name, had extorted from me a reply to his <hi>Wardword.</hi> Which certes might haue bin wel ſpared, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſufficiencie of the Knights apologie, if I had ſeene it before I had ended my reply. For what is there in the <hi>Wardword</hi> worthy of anſwer, ſeeing the ſame conſiſteth wholy of lies, and patches, and old ends ſtollen from others, &amp; often refuted before? And what anſwer can be deuiſed ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that counteruaileth not ſuch a hochpotch of words?</p>
            <p>To theſe replies publiſhed by vs, after long ſilence we ſee that <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> hath purpoſed to ſet forth a reioynder. For we haue already receiued two parts of nine, but ſo fraught with calumniations and lies, malicious and ſcornful termes, odious and filthy reproches, that it ſeemeth he hath ſpent all his ſtore of poiſon, and deſpaireth to perfect the reſt.</p>
            <p>This booke, albeit moſt contemptible, containing nothing but diſgracefull matter againſt her Maieſties proceedings, that is lately deceaſed, and childiſh diſputes for ſome few points of poperie, yet haue I thought good to handle; not for any worth, that can be in any ſuch packe of pedlary ſtuffe, ſet to ſale by this petit merchant, but for that iuſt occaſion is
<pb facs="tcp:18556:7"/> thereby giuen vnto me, to inſiſt vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our late Queene for her heroical vertues and happy gouernment, by this wicked traitor and vnworthy ſwad wickedly diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and eſpecially for her ſingular pietie and Zeale in reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring religion, and aboliſhing Poperie. O that ſhe had bene ſo happy to keepe out the Miniſters of Antichriſt once expulſed, as at the firſt to expulſe them, and put them out of her king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome! but what by yeelding to intreatie of ſome about her by this generation foully abuſed, and what by tolerating of ſuch as were ſent in by forreine enemies to practiſe againſt her life and kingdome, and what drawne backe by thoſe that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with publike enemies, ſhew as perſwaded to ſlacke execution of lawes, if not to ſuſpend them, to her owne great trouble, and to the hazard of Religion and the State, but that God by his prouidence ſupplied the defects of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By the aduerſaries <hi>Warne-word,</hi> I haue alſo bene warned to diſcourſe of the miſerable and dangerous eſtate both of kings and their ſubiects, that liue vnder the thraldom of the Pope: and that both in regard of matters of State, and of Religion. Finally, albeit <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> hitherto hath vſed ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous railing for his warrant &amp; protection againſt thoſe, that haue dealt with him: and like as a foxe purſued with hounds with the filthy ſtench of his ſtile endeuoureth to make them giue ouer the chaſe; yet I ſhall ſo touch him for his impietie, making a iest at Scriptures and Religion, for his ſcurrilitie railing without wit or modeſtie, for his doltiſh ignorance committing moſt groſſe and childiſh errors, for his lies and forgerie vſing neither reſpect of truth nor common honeſtie, that I hope I ſhall turne his laughing into another note. If I ſpeak roundly to him and his conſorts, yet I do not, as he doth, ſpeake falſly. Sharpnes he ought not to miſlike, hauing begun this courſe. Neither can others iuſtly reproue me, conſidering my aduerſaries audacious impudencie. <hi>Si falſa dicimus</hi>

In the first booke the honor of her Maieſtie late deceaſſed, and her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the alteration of religion is defended. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the grieuances of Chriſtians vnder the Popes gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in matters of conſcience and their temporal eſtate are plainely diſcouered.

                  <hi>that is made by the art of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary, and is ſweete as hony in all mouthes,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Ioſias.</hi> In his ſteps ſhe inſiſted, and <hi>behaued her ſelf vprightly in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people, &amp; took away al abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of iniquity.</hi> She reformed the abuſes and corruptions of popiſh religion, which through the working of the myſtery of iniquitie, had now won credit in the world, and ouerthrew the idoll of the Maſſe, and baniſhed all idolatrie out of the Church. <hi>She directed her heart to the Lord, and in the time of the vngodly ſhe eſtabliſhed Religion.</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:18556:9"/> She put her truſt in the Lord; and after that wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men had brought vs back into <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ſeruitude, ſhe deliuered vs from the bondage of the wicked <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and reſtored Religion according to the rules of Apoſtolicall doctrine.</p>
               <p>But becauſe as in the time of <hi>Ioſias</hi> the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> ſo in our times their of-ſpring the Maſſe-prieſts cannot brooke her reformation, but looke backe to the abominations of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> I haue thought it conuenient not only to declare at large what benefites the people of <hi>England</hi> now fiue and fortie yeares almoſt enioyed by her gracious and happie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, but alſo to iuſtifie the ſame againſt the ſlaunderous calumniations and cauils of <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> her borne ſubiect, but now a renegate <hi>Iebuſite,</hi> and profeſſed enemie, who in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wicked libels and paltrie pamphlets hath endeuoured to obſcure her great glorie, and to deface her worthie actions.</p>
               <p>Wherein, that I may proceed with more perſpicuitie, I think it fit to reaſon firſt of matters Eccleſiaſticall, and afterward of ciuill and worldly affaires. In Eccleſiaſticall affaires, which by her meanes grew to a better ſettlement, we are to conſider firſt what grace it is to haue a certaintie in religion; and next, what fauour God ſhewed to vs, reducing vs to the vnitie of the true Catholicke Church. Thirdly, we will reaſon of true faith: fourthly, of the ſincere adminiſtration of the Sacraments: fiftly, of the true worſhip of God: ſixthly, of the Scriptures and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke prayers in our mother tongue: ſeuenthly, of freedome we enioyed by her from perſecution, from the Popes exactions, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wicked lawes and vniuſt cenſures, from al heretical and falſe doctrine: eightly, of deliuerance from ſchiſme, ſuperſtition and idolatrie: and finally of good workes, and the happineſſe of thoſe, that not onely are able to diſcerne which are good workes, but alſo do walke in them according to their Chriſtian profeſſion, auoiding pretended Popiſh good-workes, that are either impious, or elſe ſuperſtitious and vnprofitable.

                     <hi>Eckius</hi> holdeth, <hi>that the Scriptures are not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical without the authority of the Church.</hi> And although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dare not allow this forme of ſpéech; yet where he defendeth the determination of the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> concerning the old Latine tranſlation, in effect he granteth it.

                     </hi> he ſaith, <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures depend vpon the Church. <hi>Scriptura</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly they teach, <hi>that the determinations of the Church are no leſſe firmely to be beleeued, and reuerently to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, then if they were expreſſed in Scriptures. <hi>Id quod ſancta mater Eccleſiae definit, vel acceptat,</hi>

                     </hi> And all our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries do beléeue, that the Popes determinations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matters of faith are infallible, and ſo to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of.</p>
                  <p>Finally, in the canon law, <hi>c. in canonicis. diſt. <hi>19.</hi>
                     </hi> they place the decretals of Popes in equall ranke with canonicall Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe poſitions it followeth, that as long as men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue the Romiſh Church, they neither beleeue truth, nor haue any certaine faith or religion. And that is proued by theſe arguments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he that beleeueth not Gods promiſes concerning his own ſaluation, is an infidel, and hath no true faith. But this is the caſe of all Papiſts. For not one of them beléeueth that he ſhall be ſaued, nor imagineth that God hath ſaid or promiſed any thing concerning his owne ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the Scriptures depend vpon the Church, and the Church is a ſocietie of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then the Papiſts beléeue Scriptures with humane faith, and depend vpon men. But that they do plainely teach.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the Church ought to conſigne canonicall Scriptures, and the Pope ought to rule the Church; then if the Pope either determine againſt canonicall Scriptures, or make fabulous ſcriptures equall with canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Papiſts are to beléeue either doctrine contrarie, or diuers from Scriptures: at the leaſt they are vncertaine what they ſhall beléeue. But the Pope may both erre in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Scriptures, and adding to Scriptures. To anſwer this the Papiſts are driuen to affirm, that the Pope cannot erre in theſe determinations. But this ſheweth the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of their faith, that dependeth vpon one little rotten goutie Pope, whoſe learning is not worth two chips, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18556:12"/> whoſe pietie is leſſe then his learning.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the Popes conſignation be neceſſary to make Papiſts beleeue Scriptures, then is their faith moſt vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and rather humane then diuine. Eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that of this Popes conſignation of Scriptures, there is not one word in Scriptures. But that is their doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the doctrine and practiſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> being the rule of faith, the Romiſh faith muſt néeds proue vncertaine and variable. The conſequence of this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is proued, for that both ſchoole-men differ from ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and late writers from the auncient, and alſo Popes from Popes, as I haue ſhewed in my bookes <hi>De pontif Rom.</hi> That the rule of faith is as I haue ſaid, it may be auerred by <hi>Stapletons</hi> words.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if faith be grounded vpon traditions, as well as vpon Scriptures, then haue the Papiſts no certaine faith. The conſequence is plaine, for that diuers ancient traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are new ceaſed: and neither <hi>Caeſar Baronius,</hi> nor any man is able to ſet downe, which are authentical traditions, which not.</p>
                  <p>Finally, if the faith of Papiſts reſt vpon the Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, or elſe vpon the ſuppoſed Catholicke Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches decrees; then is their faith a goutie, fraile, and rotten faith, or rather a moſt doubtfull opinion. For neither are they certaine who is lawfull Pope, nor that his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are vnfallible, nor is it an eaſie matter to know which are the Catholicke Churches determinations, the Papiſts themſelues contending and varying continually about them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe arguments do ſhew, that the Papiſts haue either a vaine faith, or elſe no faith at all. And this <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> notwithſtanding his obſtinacie and peruerſeneſſe muſt needs confeſſe. For ſimple Papiſts haue only theſe meanes whereby to direct themſelues: viz. Scriptures, Fathers, or their owne Prieſts. Scriptures they neither heare read in a tongue knowne, nor do they much regard them. The Fathers they vnderſtand not. The prieſts do often tel lies:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18556:12"/> and too farre they dwell from the Pope to know of him the truth. To omit to talke of ruder perſons, and to talke of ſpruce <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> gladly would I know of him, how he is aſſured that the religion he teacheth is true. Scriptures he denieth to be the rule of faith, and will not beléeue them to be authenticall, without the Popes determination. The Pope is but one man. If then he rely wholy on the Popes determination, his faith is nothing but a fooliſh fancie grounded vpon one man. If vpon the Church, yet he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Church, but by his owne reaſon and ſence (as I thinke) he will confeſſe.<note place="margin">Ward-word pag. 6.</note> Rule of faith he acknowledgeth none, <hi>but the vniuerſall Church:</hi> which is not onely abſurd, but maketh much againſt him. Abſurd it is, for that the Church is ruled, and is not the rule, no more then the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter is his rule. It maketh againſt him, for that it is more difficult to know the Catholicke Church of all times and places, then Scriptures, or any proofe of faith elſe. For to know that, it is neceſſary to be well ſeene in the hiſtorie of all times, Churches and countries. And if he refer himſelfe to others, and beléeue humane hiſtories, his faith is ſtill grounded on men.</p>
                  <p>This being the caſe of Papiſts, and of their agent <hi>Robert Parſons;</hi> we may eſtéeme our ſelues happie, that are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this great vncertaintie, and taught to build our faith vpon <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Other foundation can no man lay beſide that which is laid, that is Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. And <hi>Eph. 2. Ye are built</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe being the chiefe corner ſtone.</hi> We know, <hi>that faith commeth by hearing,</hi>

                     <hi>and hearing by the word of God.</hi> We beléeue that the Scriptures are a perfect rule, and therefore rightly called canonicall. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaking of the rule of faith, <hi>2. Cor. 10. Gal. 6.</hi> and <hi>Phil. 3.</hi> meaneth no other rule but that, which was to be found in holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers alſo procéeded by the rule of Scriptures, both where they ſought direction for themſelues, and alſo

Athan.</hi>
                     </hi> ſaith <hi>Orat. <hi>2.</hi> contr. Arian. <hi>that Heretikes are to be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with arguments out of Scriptures.</hi>
                     </hi> Out of Scriptures y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Arians</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> &amp; other Heretikes in other Synods were confuted. And generally antiquitie doth call Scriptures the <hi>canon</hi> or rule of faith. Agréeably therefore to Scriptures and Fathers the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the beginning of Quéene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne acknowledged the canon of Scriptures, and thence tooke the articles of our Chriſtian faith. And therefore I call Scriptures, and that which is neceſſarily deduced out of Scriptures <hi>the rule of faith,</hi> not ſeparating the rule from ſcriptures, as <hi>Parſons 1. <hi>Encontr. cap.</hi> 15.</hi> of his <hi>Warn-word</hi> doth cauill, but in the rule comprehending whatſoeuer is either expreſſed in termes, or by neceſſarie conſequence deduced out of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And this I did to auoide the cauils of the aduerſary, which inferre, becauſe this word <hi>Trinitie,</hi> or <hi>conſubſtantiall,</hi> or <hi>baptiſme of children</hi> is not found in Scriptures, that ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are not a ſolide and entire rule of faith.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this <hi>Parſons</hi> in his <hi>Warn-word 1. Encontr. c. 15.</hi> alleageth firſt certaine names of Fathers, then certaine words out of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtle <hi>ad Phil. Irenaeus lib. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; <hi>4.</hi> aduerſus Haereſ.

But <hi>Parſons</hi> will not deny this to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scriptures. <hi>Tertullian. <hi>de Praeſcript. aduerſ. Haeret.</hi>
                     </hi> diſputeth againſt the hereſies of the <hi>Valentinians</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites</hi> drawing arguments from the Apoſtles preaching
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18556:13"/> and tradition. But that was becauſe they denyed and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Scriptures. For no man can deny, but that their hereſies are clearely conuinced by Scriptures. <hi>Quod ſumus hoc ſunt. <hi>That we are that they are,</hi>
                     </hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaking of Scriptures. That is likewiſe the meaning of <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Lirinenſis <hi>de Haereſ. cap.</hi> 27.</hi> for that <hi>depoſt,</hi> of which he talketh, is nothing but the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith contained in ſcriptures. But if <hi>Parſons</hi> will prooue his rule of faith, he muſt ſhew a faith grounded vpon tradition, that is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of Scriptures. Nay, if he will not be contrarie to himſelfe, he muſt ſhew, that not the Apoſtles tradition, as he ſaith in his <hi>Warn-word 1. <hi>Encoun. cap.</hi> 15.</hi> but <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church is the rule of faith,</hi> as he holdeth <hi>Ward-word, <hi>Encontr. pag.</hi> 6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He doth alſo obiect againſt vs diuers alterations of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in <hi>England</hi> in king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his raigne,<note place="margin">Warn-word Encontr. c. 16.</note> and in king <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes: and then aſketh by what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie our rule of faith was eſtabliſhed. But firſt he might as well haue ſpoken of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> alteration made in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, when the impieties of Popiſh religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were eſtabliſhed by act of Parliament. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the alterations in religion made in <hi>England</hi> of late time, make no variation in the rule of faith, that is alwayes one, but in the application and vſe of it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> albeit by act of Parliament the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of religion were confirmed wherein the canon of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the ſubſtance of our confeſſion is ſet downe; yet was that rather a declaration of our acceptance, then a confirmation of the rule of faith, that in it ſelfe is alwayes immoueable. Our rule of faith therefore is certaine, albeit not alwaies in one ſort approued, or receiued by men. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of Popiſh faith neither in it ſelf, nor in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Parliaments or Churches is certaine, or immoueable.</p>
                  <p>Finally, he aſketh a queſtion of <hi>Sir Francis</hi> in his <hi>Ward-word, p. 5.</hi> how he knoweth his religion to be true. And ſaith, <hi>he hath only two meanes to guide himſelfe in this caſe,</hi> and that is either <hi>Scriptures, or the preaching of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi> But this queſtion, as I haue ſhewed, toucheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18556:14"/> that buſideth his faith vpon the Pope, nearer then <hi>Sir Francis,</hi> who groundeth himſelfe &amp; his faith only vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and is aſſured of his faith, not by theſe two meanes onely, but by diuers others. For beſide Scriptures he hath the help of the Sacraments of the Church, of Gods ſpirit working within him, of miracles recorded in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of auncient Fathers, of the practiſe of the Church, of the conſent of nations, of the confeſſion of the aduerſaries, of the ſuffering of Martyrs, and teſtimonies of learned men, and ſuch like arguments. In this queſtion therefore <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> ſhewed himſelfe to be a ſilly Frier, and to haue had more malice then might.</p>
                  <p>In time paſt alſo we were, as ſhéepe going aſtray, and out of the vnion of the Catholike and Apoſtolike Church. Diuers of our aunceſtors worſhipped the croſſe and the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the Trinitie with diuine worſhip. Some like bruite beaſts fell downe before Idols, crept to the croſſe, and kiſſed wood and ſtone. Others worſhipped Angels, the bleſſed Virgin and Saints, praying vnto them in all their neceſſities, truſting in them, ſaying Maſſes in their honour, and offering incenſe and prayers to their pictures and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For ſo they were taught, or rather miſtaught by popiſh Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>The Romiſh ſynagogue in the very foundations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was departed from the Apoſtolike and Catholike Church. The ſchoolemen brought their proofes out of the Popes Decretals, and <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Metaphyſickes. <hi>Eſt Petri ſedes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine in Praefat. ante lib. de Pont. Rom.) <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis probatus, angularis, pretioſus, in fundamento fundatus.</hi> The See of Peter, is an approued corner ſtone, precious, and laid in the foundation.</hi> The ſame man <hi>lib. 2. de Pont. Rom. cap. 31.</hi> calleth the Pope <hi>the foundation of the Church. Sanders</hi> calleth him <hi>the Rocke. <hi>Alij nunc à Chriſto</hi>
                     </hi> (ſaith <hi>Stapleton re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. <hi>princip.</hi> doctr. in Praef.) <hi>eorúmue doctrina praedicatio, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio fundamenti apud me locu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habebu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi>
                     </hi> That is: <hi>Others now beſide Chriſt, and their doctrine, preaching, and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be eſteemed of me, as a foundation.</hi> This he ſaith,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18556:14"/> where he talketh of the foundation of religion and the Church. But the catholike Church had no foundation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and his holy word and Goſpell, taught by the Prophets and Apoſtles. The Apoſtle <hi>(Gal. 1.)</hi> denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him accurſed, <hi>that taught any other Goſpell, then that, which he had preached.</hi> The holy Fathers proued the faith by holy Scriptures, and not by popiſh Decretals, and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall Principles.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Chriſts bodie the Romaniſts taught, that the ſame is both in heauen, and in the Sacrament, albeit we neither could ſee it there, nor féele it. But the ſcriptures teach vs, that his bodie is both <hi>palpable and viſible,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 24. Mar. vlt.</note> and is now <hi>taken vp into heauen.</hi> So likewiſe teach the Fathers: <hi>Vigilius</hi> in his fourth booke againſt <hi>Eutyches</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſts bodie: <hi>When it was on earth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſurely it was not in heauen; and now becauſe it is in heauen, certainely it is not on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They haue alſo brought in new doctrine concerning Purgatorie and indulgences, and which is no more like to the auncient catholike faith, then hereſie and noueltie to Chriſtian religion. They teach, <hi>that whoſoeuer doth not ſatisfie in this life for the temporall puniſhment of mortall ſinnes committed after baptiſme, and remitted concerning the guiltineſſe, muſt ſatisfie for the ſame in Purgatorie, vnleſſe it pleaſe the Pope by his indulgences to releaſe him.</hi> Of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors of ſoules in Purgatorie, and of the nature, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and effect of indulgences they talke idlely, and vnlike to the ſchollers of Catholikes.</p>
                  <p>The Catholicke doctrine concerning the Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper they haue quite changed: in Baptiſme adding ſalt, ſpittle, hallowed water, exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes, blowings, annointings, light, and other ſtrange ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. In the Lords ſupper taking away the cup from the communicants, and not deliuering, but hanging vp or carying about the Sacrament, and worſhipping it as God: and finally, beléeuing &amp; holding tranſubſtantiation. They haue alſo deuiſed other ſacraments, and taught that they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18556:15"/> containe grace and iuſtifie.</p>
                  <p>They were wont to kiſſe the Popes toe, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his dunghill decretals, worſhipping Antichriſt, and intitling him Chriſts Vicar.</p>
                  <p>All which nouelties, ſuperſtitions and hereſies, by her Maieſties godly reformation are aboliſhed, who hath reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the auncient Catholike and Apoſtolike faith, which the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> for the moſt part had altered &amp; ſuppreſſed.</p>

                  <p>We are therefore to thanke God, that the doctrine of faith in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſetled, and that refuſing all nouelties we agrée therein with the auncient catholike Church. We acknowledge one Lord, one faith, one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, one head of the Church, one canon of Scriptures with the auncient fathers. The rules of all auncient and lawfull generall Councels concerning the faith we admit.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18556:16"/> We haue one vniforme order for publike prayers, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Sacraments, and Gods ſeruice. Neither do we onely agrée among our ſelues, but alſo with the reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and other nations, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in matters of faith and ſaluation. And as for ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and rites, it cannot be denied, but that all Churches therein haue their libertie, as the diuerſities of auncient Churches and teſtimonies of Fathers do teach vs.</p>
                  <p>Moſt vaine therefore and contumelious is that diſcourſe of <hi>N.D.</hi> in his <hi>Warne-word, 1. <hi>encontr. ca.</hi> 4, 5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.</hi> where he talketh of the difference of <hi>ſoft and rigide Lutherans among themſelues; of them from Anabaptiſts, and from Zwinglians; of all from the followers of Seruetus and Valentine Gentilis.</hi> For neither do we acknowledge the names of <hi>Lutherans, Caluinians,</hi> or <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> but onely call our ſelues Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: nor haue we to do with the <hi>Arians,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> or <hi>Seruetus,</hi> or <hi>Gentilis,</hi> or any heretikes. Nay by our Doctors theſe fellowes haue bene diligently confuted, and by our gouernors the principall of them haue bene puniſhed. But theſe, may <hi>Parſons</hi> reply, haue bin among vs. Admit it were ſo: yet do not our aduerſaries take themſelues to be guiltie of <hi>Arianiſme</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſme,</hi> becauſe there are diuers guiltie of <hi>Arianiſme</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſme</hi> among them. We ſay further, that the Churches of <hi>Germany, France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> agree, albeit priuate men hold priuate opinions. Finally, where we talk of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> what a ridiculous ſot was this, to bring an inſtance of the Churches of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> or <hi>Suizzerland?</hi> nay not of the Churches, but of priuat perſons, and that in matters, not very ſubſtantiall, if we admit their owne interpretations?</p>
                  <p>Hauing therefore talked his pleaſure of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> he deſcendeth to ſpeak of <hi>rigid and ſoft Caluiniſts</hi> (as he calleth them) <hi>in England.</hi> He calleth them alſo <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and Puritanes.</hi> But neither do we admit theſe names of faction, nor is he able to ſhew that publikely any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is tolerated to diſſent, either in matters of faith, or rites from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But if any there be that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18556:16"/> miſlike our rites; yet is not that contention about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, nor can the diſorder of priuate perſons hinder the publike vnion of the Church. Finally, I do not know any man now, but he is reaſonably well ſatisfied concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters of diſcipline, albeit the ſame be with the great griefe of Papiſts, who go about to ſtirre vp the coles of contention, as much as they can, that heretofore haue bene couered.</p>

                  <p>TRue faith in time of Poperie was a great ſtranger in <hi>England,</hi> moſt men being ignorant of all points of chriſtian Religion, the reſt holding diuers erronious points and hereſies. Their ignorance we ſhall proue by diuers te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies hereafter. Their errors and hereſies are very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and at large proued in my late challenge. That which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>the doctrine of diuels, 1. Tim. 4.</hi> that they imbrace for doctrine of faith. For they forbid their Prieſts, Monkes, Friers, and Nuns to marrie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the <hi>Benedictines</hi> and their <hi>Charterhouſe</hi> Monkes at all times to abſtaine from fleſh. They alſo forbid men to eate fleſh vpon all faſting dayes, fridayes and ſaterdayes, and in Lent: diſſoluing the commandements of God by their owne traditions. The <hi>Manicheyes</hi> abſtained from egges as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſheweth, <hi>lib. de haereſ. cap. <hi>46.</hi> Nec oua ſaltem ſumunt, quaſi &amp; ipſa cùm franguntur expirent, nec o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteat vllis corporibus mortuis veſci.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. plurimi, diſt. 82.</note> So likewiſe did Papiſts at certain times, they cal ſuch as allow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mariage of prieſts, <hi>ſectatores libidinum, &amp; praeceptores vitiorum</hi> that is, <hi>followers of luſts, and teachers of vices:</hi> albeit the Apoſtle affirmeth mariage to be honorable in all ſorts of men. They diſſolue ſuch mariages, albeit <hi>Chriſt</hi> teach, <hi>that man is not to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18556:17"/> them whom God hath ioyned together.</hi> Their Faſtes they place in eating of fiſh, and not in abſtinence from all ſuſtenance, as the auncient Fathers by their doctrine and practiſe taught. Some count it as mortall ſinne to eate fleſh on fridayes, as to kill a man, and that a Prieſt doth ſinne leſſe in committing fornication, then in matching himſelfe in honeſt mariage: and yet they confeſſe, that fornication is againſt the law of God, and not the mariages of prieſts.</p>
                  <p>They tolerated common whores, as did <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and other heretickes: and now in <hi>Rome</hi> the Pope notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his pretended holineſſe, receiueth a tribute from them.

                     </hi> The Papiſts therefore haue their faſts from others then from <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Manicheys</hi> they borrow their communions vnder one kind, as may be proued by the Chapt. <hi>relatum,</hi> and <hi>comperimus. diſt. <hi>2.</hi> de conſecrat.</hi> and by <hi>Leo</hi> his fourth Sermon <hi>de quadrageſ.</hi>

                     </hi> his words are theſe. <hi>Chriſtum non vnum dicunt, ſed hunc quidem infernè, illum verò ſupernè.</hi> So likewiſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts teach, that Chriſts bodie in heauen is viſible and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, but not as it is in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>With the <hi>Pelagians</hi> they concurre in many points, as I haue at large declared in my late challenge. <hi>Hoc Pelagiani laudent dicere</hi> (ſaith <hi>S.

                     </hi> Now how can they cleare themſelues from this, that hold, that a man is able to performe the law of God perfectly?</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> denyeth, that we are iuſtified before God by the workes of the law. The Papiſts haue taught quite contrarie. He teacheth vs not to glorie in our works. They ſay quite contrarie, that men may glorie in their workes. He ſheweth that as many as receiue the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords bodie, are alſo to receiue the ſacrament of his bloud. They denie the cuppe to all the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants beſide the prieſt. Our Sauiour inſtituting the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his laſt ſupper, ſaid, <hi>Accipite, manducate:</hi> that is, <hi>take and eate.</hi> Theſe imagine that he offered his bodie and bloud really and corporally at his laſt ſupper, and that he appointed his bodie and bloud actually to be offered in the Maſſe, and not alwaies to be ſacramentally and ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued of the communicants.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:18556:18"/>
                  <p>The Papiſts teach, that wicked men, reprobates, and diuels may haue true faith. But the Apoſtle teacheth that true faith iuſtifieth, &amp; that they which haue it, <hi>liue by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Commonly they hold, that charitie is the forme of faith. Which if it were true, then could not faith ſubſiſt without charitie. But the Apoſtle teacheth vs, that faith, as faith, doth make the iuſt to liue, and auncient Chriſtians were alwayes ignorant of theſe philoſophicall fancies.</p>
                  <p>They hold that diuers ſinnes are committed, which are not forbidden by Gods law. But this ſheweth, that the law of God as they ſuppoſe, is not perfect, and that the lawes of man hauing nothing in them of Gods law, bind the conſcience as well as the law of God.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the very foundations of popiſh religion are er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious, the ſame being founded partly vpon the decretals of Popes, partly vpon the traditions of men, contained partly in their Miſſals, breuiaries, ond other rituall books, partly in their fabulous legends, and partly in the cheſt of the Popes breſt: and partly vpon the old Latin tranſlation of the Bible, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> hold to be authenticall: and partly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the interpretations of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>But ſince it pleaſed God to put into her Maieſties royall heart a reſolution to reforme the church, that was ſo much deformed by the phariſaicall and ſuperſtitious additions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſts, &amp; to reſtore religion according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles &amp; Prophets, not only all former hereſies &amp; errors were aboliſhed, but alſo the true doctrine of faith was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The which is apparent not onely by the articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which we profeſſe, but alſo by our publike confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and apologies, which we haue publiſhed at diuers times. And in part it may be proued by the ſecret confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our aduerſaries. For albeit they would gladly cauill againſt our confeſſions; yet they take their grounds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly out of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Caluin, Melancthon</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not often medling with our confeſſions. Diuers of them alſo are wont to call vs <hi>negatiue Diuines.</hi> Which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, that ſo much as we hold poſitiuely, is for the moſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18556:18"/> part confeſſed by the aduerſaries themſelues, and that we bring in no new faith, but that which alwayes hath bene holden and maintained in the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> deſiring onely that the poſitiue errors, hereſies and ſuperſtitions of Papiſts may be aboliſhed.

                  <p>OF the holy rites and ſacraments of Chriſtian religion we cannot ſpeake without griefe of heart, when we conſider how ſhamefully they were abuſed, mangled and corrupted by the ſynagogue of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Where Chriſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained onely two Sacraments, to wit Baptiſme, where he ſaid, <hi>Teach all nations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt:</hi> and the ſacrament of his body and blood, where he ſaid, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body, and drinke ye all of this: for this is the blood of the new teſtament; and do this in remembrance of me:</hi> that ſynagogue hath added fiue other ſacraments, giuing the ſame vertue to their extreme vnction, and to mariage and orders concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning iuſtification, that they giue to Baptiſme &amp; the Lords ſupper.<note place="margin">Lib. ſent. 4. diſt. 2.</note> The maſter of the Sentences rehearſing the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, for the Lords ſupper putteth <hi>Panis benedictionem,</hi> that is, <hi>the bleſſing of the bread,</hi> excluding the cup either from the Lords ſupper, or from the number of ſacraments. He doth alſo differ from the reſt in deſcribing the vertue of the ſacraments.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                     <hi>Alia remedium contra peccatum praebent</hi> (ſaith

                     </hi> that is, <hi>by vertue of the worke wrought.</hi> As if all maried men, and prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> were iuſtified, or as if iuſtification and grace came by grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſcraping, croſſing and ſuch other ceremonies. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they able to iuſtifie this doctrine, nor to ſhew either inſtitution, or promiſe of confirmation, or extreme vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or certaine ſigne of mariage, or repentance, or order, or the other two new deuiſed ſacraments. Furthermore, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, repentance, and prieſthood, were as well vſed in the time of the law, as in the Goſpell. How then can theſe be ſacraments of the Goſpell?</p>
                  <p>They haue alſo altered, corrupted, and mangled Chriſt his inſtitution, concerning the Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper. In baptime they ſalt and coniure the water in which the party baptized is to be dipped. They put ſalt into his mouth, and touch his eares and noſthrils with ſpittle, which is oft times very noiſom. They annoint him alſo on the head, and giue him a candle in his hand, and embroyle Chriſt his inſtitution with diuers other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Finally, to make water more effectuall, they poure oyle into the font.</p>
                  <p>In the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper inſtituted in bread and wine, they leaue neither the ſubſtance of bread nor wine, but ſay, that the ſame is tranſſubſtantiated into Chriſts body and blood, and that either his body and blood, or the accidents of bread and wine ſubſiſting without their ſubſtance make the ſacrament. Secondly they hold, <hi>that Chriſts body and bloud are conioyned without any diſtance to the accidents of bread and wine, albeit they are not there ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18556:19"/> felt or ſeene.</hi> Thirdly, they haue turned the ſacrament of our communion with Chriſt, and of our mutuall coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction one with another, into a priuate action of one Prieſt, that eateth and drinketh all alone vncharitably, and very directly contrary to Chriſt his inſtitution, who ioyntly ſaid, <hi>Accipite &amp; manducate, hoc eſt corpus meum:</hi> and <hi>bibite ex hoc omnes: <hi>Take, eate, this is my body:</hi>
                     </hi> and <hi>drinke ye all of this:</hi> contrary to the practiſe of the auncient Church, that neuer ſolemnized this action without diſtribution of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and contrary to the vſe and reaſon of the ſacrament. For why ſhould not the faithfull be made partakers of that ſacrament, which is a ſigne of their vnion both with Chriſt and among themſelues? Fourthly, Chriſt and his Apoſtles adminiſtred the cup to as many as receiued the holy eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. But they by a ſolemne decrée of prieſts at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> take away the cup from all ſaue the prieſts that ſay Maſſe. Fiftly, Chriſt ordained that the ſacrament of his body and bloud ſhould be diſtributed and receiued in that action: theſe fellowes kéepe the ſacrament in a boxe, and cary it about in ſolemne proceſſions. Sixthly, they worſhip the ſacrament, and call it <hi>their Lord and God,</hi> contrary to all rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. Seuenthly, Chriſt appointed a holy ſacrament, and gaue not his body and bloud to be offered continually in the Maſſe, as a ſacrifice auaileable for quicke and dead, as theſe good fellowes do beléeue. Finally, the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that as oft as we celebrate this holy action, <hi>we ſhew forth the Lords death vntill his comming againe.</hi> But the Papiſts forbid this action to be celebrated in a vulgar tong, which is commonly vnderſtood of the people, as much as in them lyeth hindring them from ſhewing forth the Lords death: they hold alſo that he is already come, and preſent in the ſacrament.</p>
                  <p>But the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth religiouſly obſerue Chriſt his inſtitution, and that doctrine which the Apoſtles haue deliuered vnto vs. The ſame admitteth no ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts but two, that is, Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper. In Baptiſme we refuſe the idle and ſuperſtitious ceremonies

                  <p>The ſacraments therefore of the new Teſtament being pledges of Gods loue, and ſeales of Gods graces, whereby he worketh in vs, we are not lightly to prize the true and ſincere adminiſtration of them according to Chriſts holy inſtitution, nor to eſteeme this a ſmall benefite, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning the holy ſacraments being reformed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the canon of Gods word, both the ſuperſtitious ceremonies in Baptiſme, and the idolatrous Maſſe, with al abuſes depending thereon, were abrogated and remoued out of the Church, and the celebration of Chriſts holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments conformed according to the prime inſtitution. Many godly Emperors and Kings haue deſerued praiſe in going about to reforme abuſes crept into the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſacraments before their time: but none more then our late moſt gracious Quéene, that from extreme abuſes brought all to a moſt excellent order.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18556:20"/> Maieſties authoritie in the Church of <hi>England</hi> it wil hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be of poſteritie beléeued, but that there are monuments of like corruptions yet remaining in diuers other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and good records and memorials yet remaining of their notorious abuſes in this countrie. The faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters that were yet remaining vpon the comming in of Quéene <hi>Marie,</hi> wept to ſée the deſolation of the Church,<note place="margin">Pſal. 137.</note> as the people of God caried into captiuitie, when they ſate by the waters of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and remembred <hi>Sion.</hi> They that now liue wonder at the groſſeneſſe of popiſh errors. For firſt they erred in the rule of Gods worſhip. <hi>In vaine</hi> (ſayth our Sauiour <hi>Mat. 15.) do they worſhip me teaching for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines the precepts of men.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>(Coloſ. <hi>2.</hi>)</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>voluntarie,</hi> or <hi>new deuiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> or as the old Latine interpreter hath tranſlated that word, <hi>ſuperſtition.</hi> For ſo indéede humane deuiſes for the ſeruice of God without warrant of Gods word are for the moſt part to be called and eſtéemed. God in expreſſe tearms refuſeth ſuch deuiſed ſeruices, ſaying, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi> But the founders of popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as if God had appointed vs no certaine rule for theſe matters, haue placed the perfection of their religion in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie vowes of abſtinence from mariage, of pretended beggerie, and of other Monkiſh and Friarlike obſeruances, and ſuch like humane traditions. <hi>Bellarmine <hi>de Monachis cap.</hi> 2.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Monkiſh religion is a ſtate of men tending to Chriſtian perfection by the vowes of pouertie, continencie, and obedience.</hi> But if a man ſhould aſke him, who taught men to aſpire to perfection in this race, he will be to ſéeke for an anſwer. That God requireth or approueth ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, it will neuer be proued. They do alſo eſtéeme it a high peece of Gods ſeruice, to kéep holidayes in honor of Saints created by the Pope, in faſting vpon Saints vigils, in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtock-fiſh, coleworts, to adeſtooles, and ſuch like toyes, in praying vpon beades, in often repeating <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> in worſhipping of ſtones, bones, and rotten ragges, they know not of whom, in humbling themſelues before Angels
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18556:21"/> and Saints, and the Sacrament of the altar, in ſaying our Ladies Pſalter, in ringing bels, in going barefoote, and woolward, and whipping themſelues. By ſaying ouer the <hi>Roſarie of our Ladie</hi> onely, they report, that diuers mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles haue bene wrought. Diuers thouſands of yeares of indulgences alſo are graunted to the company of the <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> or beades of our Ladie, as is recorded in a booke intitled <hi>Miracoli della ſantiſsima vergine Maria,</hi> printed at <hi>Venice</hi> by <hi>Bernard Giunti anno 1587.</hi> Matters which no man would admit, but fellowes made of wood, coleworts, and ſtockfiſh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are deceiued in the manner of Gods worſhip: and that in thrée ſorts. For <hi>firſt</hi> their worſhip is almoſt wholy externall conſiſting in outward ceremonies, as namely, in often rehearſall of <hi>Credo,</hi> or <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> or <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> or being preſent at the Maſſe, albeit they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing, or ſprinkling themſelues with holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or often croſſing themſelues, or going to <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> or lighting of candles, or ringing, knocking, or greaſing, or ſuch like. But our Sauiour reprehendeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that come neare to God with their lippes, <hi>and haue their hearts farre from him:</hi> and ſheweth, that true worſhippers ſhall <hi>worſhip him in ſpirit and truth.</hi> Next, they offend grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly in giuing too great honor to Angels, Saints, ſtocks, ſtones, and rotten bones. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Ripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> teacheth vs otherwiſe. <hi>Nos non dico Martyrum reliquias &amp;c. <hi>We</hi>

                     </hi> ſpeaking of Angels, <hi>Honoramus eos,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>charitate non ſeruitute, nec eis templa conſtruimus. <hi>We honor them with loue, and not with ſeruice, and build no temples vnto them. Epiphanius haereſ. 79.</hi>
                     </hi> ſpeaking of Angels, ſaith directly, <hi>that he would not haue Angels worſhipped.</hi> But Papiſts kiſſe dumbe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, pray before them, burne incenſe vnto them. They
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18556:21"/> teach alſo, that ſeruice is due to Saints, and that we are to giue <hi>latriam,</hi> or diuine honour to the croſſe, to the crucifixe, to the ſacrament of the altar, and the images of the perſons of the holy <hi>Trinitie,</hi> which they indeuour to faſhion in wood, mettal, and colours. They offend <hi>thirdly</hi> in the forme of their prayers, which are found in their <hi>Miſſals, Breuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and rituall bookes, and which cannot be denied to be both falſe and blaſphemous. <hi>Gaude Maria virgo</hi> (ſay they) <hi>cunctas haereſes ſola interemiſti in vniuerſo mundo:</hi> that is, <hi>reioyce virgin Marie: thou alone haſt killed al haereſies in al the world.</hi> What then, I pray you, did <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the meane while? and what did all other Saints? And againe: <hi>O Maria, admitte preces noſtras intra ſacrarium tuae exauditionis, &amp; reporta nobis antidotum reconciliationis, &amp;c. <hi>O Marie, admit our prayers within the holy place of your hearing, and bring vnto vs the triacle of reconciliation.</hi>
                     </hi> And yet they ſay, Saints departed do not ſée, nor know things below, but by ſéeing them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the face of God, as it were in a glaſſe.<note place="margin">In Miſſall Rom.</note> On <hi>S. Andrewes</hi> day they pray in this forme: <hi>Sanctifie (ô Lord) theſe gifts dedicated vnto thee, and the bleſſed Martyr Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus interceding for vs, by the ſelfe ſame being pleaſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vs, by our Lord, &amp;c.</hi> As if the Lords bodie, which is the thing meant by thoſe gifts, néeded ſanctification, or elſe as if it were conuenient, that God being reconciled to vs by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould no otherwiſe intend our prayers, then by the interceſſion of <hi>Saturninus.</hi> On <hi>S. Nicholas</hi> his day they ſay thus: <hi>Deus qui B. Nicolaum innumeris decoraſti miraculis, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bue quaeſumus, vt eius meritis &amp; precibus a Gehennae incendijs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beremur.</hi> That is: <hi>O God which haſt adorned S. Nicholas with innumerable miracles, grant, we beſeech thee, that by his merits and prayers, we may be deliuered from hell fire.</hi> Which implyeth, that not onely the miracles reported in <hi>S. Nicholas</hi> his legend are true, but alſo that by his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are deliuered and ſaued from hell. In the Porteſſe they pray thus: <hi>Tu per Thomae ſanguinem, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>Thou ô Chriſt, by the bloud of Thomas, which for thee he did ſpend, make vs to climbe, whither Thomas did aſcend.</hi> And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18556:22"/> againe: <hi>Opem nobis ô Thoma porrige, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>yeeld vs your help ô <hi>Thomas,</hi> gouerne them that ſtand, raiſe them vp that lie: our manners, actions, and life correct, and direct vs into the way of peace.</hi> Which argueth, that <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer not onely to intercede for vs, but to gouerne and rule our actions. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, granted great indulgences to thoſe that ſayd this prayer: <hi>Haile <hi>Marie</hi> full of grace, the Lord is with thee, bleſſed art thou amongſt women, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the fruite of thy wombe Ieſus Chriſt, and bleſſed is <hi>Anna</hi> thy mother, of whom thy virgins fleſh is proceeded without blot of originall ſinne.</hi> And yet it containeth a plaine corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words of ſcripture, and a contradiction to ſome of his owne decrees. But the greateſt fault is this, that it is repugnant to plaine words of ſcripture.</p>

Firſt ſaith he, <hi>let this whipſter tell vs, where we were taught to ſay, O ſtocke, or O ſtone help vs.</hi> As if it were not abſurd to pray before ſtockes and ſtones, and to giue dumbe images the ſame honor that is due to the originals. Or elſe, as if they committed no fault becauſe they ſay not, <hi>O ſtocke, or O ſtone.</hi> This excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therfore declareth, that the moule of this old hackſters cap was blockiſh, and ſenſleſſe, like as if it were made of ſtone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly he ſaith, <hi>that S. Baſil <hi>homil.</hi> 20. <hi>in</hi> 40. <hi>martyres,</hi> prayeth to the ſame martyrs, that Nazianzen <hi>in laudem Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani martyris,</hi> maketh his prayer to the ſaid <hi>Cyprian:</hi> and in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in praiſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in his oration in praiſe of <hi>Baſil,</hi> to S. <hi>Baſil;</hi> that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> prayed to S. <hi>Peter</hi> in a certaine ſermon of <hi>Peters</hi> chaine, and that S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> called on the ſame Apoſtle <hi>comment in cap.</hi> 22. <hi>Luc.</hi> and <hi>S. Ierome</hi> on <hi>S. Paula in epitaph. Paulae.</hi> And that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> prayed to <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> and other Saints, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de baptiſ. contr. Donatiſt. cap.</hi> 1.</hi> But firſt there is an infinit difference betwéen the words of the Fathers, and the blaſphemous formes of popiſh pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They by a figure called <hi>Proſopopoeia</hi> did ſpeake to ſaints, as Orators do to heauen, or earth, or cities, or other
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18556:22"/> things, that heare nothing. Theſe pray to them as if they heard them, ſaw them, and could helpe them. Secondly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ambroſe</hi> prayeth to <hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and other ſaints in the places mentioned. Thirdly, neither can he proue that the ſermon made vpon the adoration of <hi>S. Peters</hi> chaine is authentical, nor that the oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Baſil, Nazianzene</hi> and other fathers, are cléere of all corruptions, which differ ſo much in diuers editions. Finally, we liue by lawes, and not by the examples of three or foure fathers, diſagréeing from the reſt, if ſo be it were granted that they called vpon ſaints.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly he alleageth,<note place="margin">2. Encont. ca, 12. num. 9.</note> that in the firſt prayer to <hi>Thomas Becket, there is no more blaſphemy contained then when the holy prophets did mention the name, faith and merits of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and other their holy fathers.</hi> But what if the holy Prophets do not mention the merites of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> but rather deſire God to remember his promiſe made vnto them? Doth it not appeare that in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of holy Prophets, he lyeth moſt ſhamefully, and like a falſe prophet and teacher? Againe, he ſheweth himſelfe both ſhameleſſe and ſenſeleſſe, that perceiueth no difference betwéene the Papiſts, that pray they may attaine heauen by the bloud of <hi>Thomas Becket;</hi> and the Prophets, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer prayed in that faſhion, nor hoped to attaine heauen by the bloud of any, but of the immaculate Lambe <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally he anſwereth,<note place="margin">Ibid. num 10</note> 
                     <hi>That where Thomas Becket is prayed vnto, to lend his hand for our helpe, it is meant he ſhal do it, by his prayer and interceſſion.</hi> But this anſwer is as fooliſh, as the prayer is blaſphemous. For there is great difference betweene the word <hi>helpe,</hi> and this prayer, <hi>Be a meanes, that we may be holpen.</hi> Againe, albeit the meaning of the word were ſo, yet it is a ridiculous thing to pray to any to gouerne, direct and helpe vs, that cannot gouerne, direct nor helpe vs; and farre from the meaning of Papiſts, who in their Legends tell vs, that Saints haue appeared, holpen, and healed ſuch, as haue called vpon them. This
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18556:23"/> excuſe therefore will by no meanes reléeue the aduerſaries, whoſe prayers in their <hi>Miſſals,</hi> and other rituall bookes are repugnant to Chriſtian religion, and the formes and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the auncient Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Finally,</hi> they erred in the obiect of their worſhip, adoring creatures in ſtead of the Creator, or at the leaſt aduancing creatures vnto honor not due vnto them. The law expreſly forbiddeth vs to worſhip ſtrange Gods, or to haue them. But the Papiſts do worſhip the Sacrament newly made by the prieſt, and call it <hi>their Lord and God:</hi> which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange God, and neuer knowne to Chriſtians for a god. Neither can they pretend, that they giue honor to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as to the bodie of our Sauiour, while he liued v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth. For this honor was due by reaſon of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall vnion of the two natures in one Chriſt. But there is no perſonall vnion betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the ſacrament. That they call the Sacrament <hi>their Lord and their Maker;</hi> it is apparent by the common ſpéech vſed by the Papiſtes. Further in the canon of the Maſſe, the prieſt looking vpon the Sacrament, ſaith: <hi>Domine non ſum dignus: <hi>Lord, I am not worthie. Innocentius</hi> lib. <hi>4.</hi> de Miſſa cap. <hi>19.</hi>
                     </hi> ſpeaking of Tranſſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the prieſts words, ſaith, that <hi>ſo dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a creature is made the Creator. <hi>Ita ergo quotidiè creatura fit Creator.</hi>
                     </hi> The author of the booke called <hi>Stella Clericorum,</hi> ſaith, that the prieſt <hi>is the creator of his Creator. <hi>Sacerdos</hi>
                     </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eſt creator ſui Creatoris. Qui creauit vos dedit creare ſe. Qui creauit vos abſque vobis creatur a vobis mediantibus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis.</hi> The like words are found in the worthy book called <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones diſcipuli, ſer. <hi>111.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the law forbiddeth vs to make any ſimilitude, or image of things in heauen, earth, or vnder the earth, to bow downe to it, or to worſhip it. But they make the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God the Father, and the holy Ghoſt, and the crucifix, bow downe to them, and worſhip them and that according to the doctrine of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> with the ſame worſhip that is due vnto God. They do alſo make the images of Angels and Saints, burne incenſe vnto them, pray before
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18556:23"/> them, and kiſſe them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they confeſſe their ſins to Angels and Saints, ſaying: <hi>Confiteor Deo Omnipotenti, beatae Mariae ſemper virgini &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>I confeſſe to God Almightie, to the bleſſed and alwayes a virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to <hi>S. Michael</hi> the Archangell, to <hi>S. Iohn</hi> Baptiſt,</hi> and as it followeth in the common confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But if they did not beléeue that Angels and Saints can forgiue ſinnes, they would not ſo pray vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they make their vowes to ſaints, as appeareth by the common formes of vowes of ſuch as enter into Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo <hi>lib. <hi>3.</hi> de cult. ſanctor. c. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </hi> confeſſeth, that vowes may be well made to ſaints. But the ſcriptures teach vs, that this is an honor due vnto God. <hi>Pay thy vows to the moſt high,</hi> ſaith the prophet <hi>Pſalm. 50.</hi> and <hi>Deuter. 23. when thou ſhalt vow a vow to the Lord thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, they pray to the croſſe, ſaying: <hi>Auge pijs iuſtitiam, reiſ<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> dona veniam:</hi> that is, <hi>increaſe iuſtice in the godly, and graunt pardon to ſinners:</hi> as if a ſtocke could encreaſe iuſtice, or pardon ſinners.</p>
                  <p>We are therefore herein to acknowledge Gods fauour, and continually to praiſe him for his goodnes, who gaue vs ſuch a Queen, as with al her heart ſought to pul downe the altars and groues of <hi>Baal,</hi> to root out idolatry and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to reſtore Gods true worſhip. In the beginning of her reigne the holy ſcriptures were reſtored to the people in their mother tongue, and Gods true worſhip eſtabliſhed in the Church according to that rule. God was ſerued in ſpirit and truth, and the ſeruice of the Church brought back to the auncient forme of Chriſts primitiue Church.</p>

Pet. 1.</hi> they would if they durſt, plainely prohibite ſcriptures, as appéereth by the practiſe of the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Fryers in the time of <hi>William <hi>de ſanct. amore,</hi>
                     </hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brought all their fancies and traditions into one vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,<note place="margin">Doctores Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſ. de penc. nouiſ. temp.</note> and calling the ſame <hi>the eternal Goſpel;</hi> preached, <hi>that the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ceaſe, and that their eternal Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould be preached and receiued to the end of the world.</hi> The Pope alſo could hardly be enduced to condemne this blaſphemous booke of the Fryers. In the end, I confeſſe, he was forced for ſhame to aboliſh it; yet he conceiued infinite diſpleaſure againſt the Doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> and fauored the Fryers as much as he could. And now, albeit he hath not ſimply prohibited the tranſlation of ſcriptures, and reading them in vulgar tongues; yet he hath ſo limited the ſame, as in effect they are as good as prohibited. For firſt he will not permit, that ſcriptures tranſlated into vulgar tongues ſhall be read publikely in the Church: as both the <hi>Trent</hi> conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and the practiſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church declareth.

Thirdly, we do not find that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are haſtie in ſetting forth tranſlations of ſcriptures in vulgar tongues; nor can I learne that the Bible is hitherto tranſlated into the <hi>Spaniſh, Italian</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> tongue by them. Fourthly, they will haue no Booke-ſellers ſel Bibles though tranſlated into vulgar tongues by them ſelues without leaue. Fiftly, they wil not permit any man to read Bibles ſo tranſlated by themſelues without leaue. Sixtly, they graunt leaue to none to reade ſcriptures in vulgar tongues, albeit allowed by themſelues, but to ſuch onely, as they ſuppoſe to be reſolued, or rather drowned in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18556:24"/> dregges of Popiſh errors; and to lay men ſeldome, or neuer do they grant the ſame. I do not beleeue that <hi>Robert Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> albeit well acquainted in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> can name a dooſen lay men of either nation, that haue licence to reade Scriptures in vulgar tongues; or that had licence in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> time to reade Scriptures tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into their mother tongue. If he know any ſuch, he may do well to name them. If he name them not, his ſilence wil bréed ſuſpition, if it be not taken for a plaine confeſſion. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> if any among the Papiſts be taken with other tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, then ſuch as themſelues allow, or not hauing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe obtained licence according to the foreſaid rule; he is preſently taken for ſuſpect of hereſie, and ſeuerely puniſhed if he acquite not himſelfe the better. So we ſée, that among them it is lawfull to reade all prophane bookes, if they fall not within the compaſſe of their prohibition, and to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ouer the lying legends of Saints, and the fabulous booke of <hi>Conformities of Saint Francis with Chriſt,</hi> and that without leaue. But Scriptures tranſlated into vulgar tongues no man may reade without leaue.</p>
                  <p>Now how contrarie this courſe is to the word of God, to the practiſe of Gods Church, and to all reaſon, we may eaſily perceiue by theſe particulars. God would haue the words of the law not onely a continuall ſubiect of our talke and meditations,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> but alſo to be written at the entrances and doores of our houſes. Our Sauiour Chriſt preaching to the Iewes willed them <hi>to ſearch the Scriptures.</hi> But how can this be done, if Scriptures be not tranſlated into tongs which we vnderſtand, and if no man may reade them without leaue?</p>
                  <p>In the primitiue Church they were publikely read in the <hi>Syrian, Egyptian, Punicke</hi> &amp; other vulgar tongues. By the teſtimonie of <hi>Bede <hi>hiſt. Angl. lib.</hi> 1.</hi> it appeareth they were tranſlated into the <hi>Britiſh</hi> tongue, and into other vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongues, <hi>the myſteries of religion being made common to diuers nations by the meditation of Scriptures.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 2. aduerſ. haereſ. cap. 46</note> 
                     <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaking of all the Scriptures, ſaith, <hi>They may be heard
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18556:25"/> alike of all. Hierome</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Laeta,</hi> and in another to <hi>Celantia</hi> exhorteth them to reade Scriptures. But how can they be heard alike, if they may not be tranſlated, nor read publikely in vulgar toungs? And why ſhould it be more lawfull for <hi>Laeta</hi> and <hi>Celantia</hi> to reade Scriptures, then for other men and women? In his Commentaries likewiſe vpon the <hi>86. Pſalme,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that Scriptures are read to all, that all may vnderſtand. <hi>Scriptura populis omnibus legitur, vt omnes intelligant.</hi>
                     </hi> But how can the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnderſtand a ſtrange toung? <hi>Chryſoſtome <hi>homil. 9. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad Coloſſ.</hi>
                     </hi> teacheth, that the Apoſtle commandeth lay men to reade ſcriptures, and <hi>that with great diligence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle teacheth vs, that the word of God is <hi>the ſword of the ſpirit.</hi> And before I haue ſhewed, that it is light. Our Sauiour ſaith, that the word of God is food to our ſoule. <hi>Baſil. homil. 29.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament are the treaſure of the Church. <hi>Vetus &amp; nouum Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi>
                     </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>theſaurus Eccleſiae.</hi> In his Commentaries vpon the firſt <hi>Pſalme</hi> he ſheweth, that the holy Scriptures are a ſtorehouſe for all medicines for mans ſoule. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome Homil. in Pſalm. 147.</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Scriptures are our armes, and munitions in the ſpirituall warfare, which we haue againſt the diuell. <hi>Armae &amp; comeatus eius belli, quod eſt inter nos &amp; diabolum, ſunt Scripturarum auditio.</hi>
                     </hi> Doth it not then appeare, that the Papiſts are enemies to Chriſtians, and ſéeke to murther their ſoules, that by all meanes ſéeke to expoſe them naked vnto their enemies weapons, and wold willingly depriue them of medicines, munitions, armes and foode, and leaue them in darkneſſe without the comfort of Scriptures? For how can they vſe Scriptures, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them not? And how can they vnderſtand them, when they are read in toungs vnknowne? And how can they come to reade them, when there are ſo many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in obtaining licence to haue them?</p>
                  <p>Séeing then at her Maieſties firſt entrance into her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, we were fréed from the thraldome and ſlauery of Antichriſt, and had the Scriptures in a tongue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18556:25"/> reſtored vnto vs, and read publikely, and priuately without limitation or danger; we are to accompt the ſame, as a ſingular benefit beſtowed vpon the people of <hi>England.</hi> For what can be deemed more beneficiall, then for the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie to obtaine food, for naked ſouldiers to obtaine armes and prouiſions, for poore people in want, to be enriched with ſuch a treaſure?</p>
                  <p>But ſaith <hi>N. D. Wardw. pag. 14. If the tranſlator do not put downe the words of Scriptures ſincerely, in his vulgar tranſlation, then the ſimple reader, that cannot diſcerne, will take mans word for Gods word.</hi> Secondly, he ſaith, <hi>that if a falſe ſence ſhould be gathered out of Scripture, then the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould ſucke poiſon in ſtead of wholeſome meate.</hi> But theſe reaſons make no more againſt reading Scriptures in vulgar tongues, and tranſlating them into thoſe tongues, then againſt reading Scriptures in the Latin, and tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into Latine. For as well may the Latine Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter erre, as he that tranſlateth ſcriptures into vulgar tongues: and aſwell may a man draw a peruerſe ſence out of the Latine, as out of the Engliſh. If then theſe reaſons conclude not againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Latin tranſlation, they are too weak to conclude againſt vulgar tranſlations. Againe, if it be hurtfull to follow a corrupt tranſlation, and to gather a contrarie ſence out of ſcriptures; we are not therefore to caſt away ſcriptures, but rather to ſéeke for the moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere tranſlations, and the moſt true ſence and meaning of the holy Ghoſt reuealed in holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he alleageth theſe words out of the Apoſtle, <hi>2. Cor. 3. The letter killeth, but the ſpirit quickneth:</hi> againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſcriptures in vulgar tongues. But theſe words do no leſſe touch them that follow the letter in the Hebrew &amp; Gréek, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the vulgar tongs. And yet <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> wil not deny, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is lawfull to reade ſcriptures in Hebrew and Gréeke: albeit he, if it were vnlawfull, would neuer be guiltie of this fault, being moſt ignorant of theſe tongs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he aſketh, <hi>how vnlearned readers will diſcerne things without a guide.</hi> As if lay-men, becauſe they haue tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18556:26"/> might not alſo reade the books from whence the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian doctrine are deriued. This therefore ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be all one, as if Geometricians, and other teachers of arts ſhould debarre their ſchollers from reading <hi>Euclide</hi> and other authors that haue written of arts. Furthermore albeit ſomethings without teachers cannot of rude lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be vnderſtood; yet all things that pertaine to faith and manners, are plainely ſet downe in ſcriptures. <hi>In ijs quae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertè in ſcripturis poſita ſunt, inueniuntur illa omnia,</hi> ſaith <hi>S.

                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> he alleageth, <hi>that the vnderſtanding of Scriptures is a particular gift of God.</hi> But that notwithſtanding, no man is forbidden to reade ſcriptures in <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> or <hi>Latine.</hi> And yet if <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> vnderſtand them at all, he vnderſtandeth them better in the vulgar Engliſh, then in theſe tongues. Furthermore, albeit to vnderſtand Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be a peculiar gift of God, yet no man is therefore to refraine from reading of ſcriptures, but rather to reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diligently, and to conferre with the learned, and to beſéech God to giue him grace to vnderſtand them. The which is proued by the example of the Eunuch, <hi>Act. 8.</hi> who read the ſcriptures, and threw them not away, albeit he could not vnderſtand all without the help of a teacher.</p>

                     </hi> And againe: <hi>Barathrum eſt ſcripturarum ignoratio:</hi> that is, <hi>the ignorance of ſcriptures is a bottomleſſe gulfe.</hi> Finally, to obſcure the glorie of this benefite of reading ſcriptures in vulgar tongues, in his out-worne <hi>Warne-word <hi>Encont.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</hi> he ſaith, that ſuch as vnderſtand Latin, or haue licence of the Ordinary to reade ſcriptures in vulgar tongues, haue no benefit by this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall permiſſion of reading ſcriptures: as if euery one that vnderſtandeth Latin durſt reade vulgar tranſlations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licence, or as if the Church receiued no benefite, vnleſſe euery particular member were partaker of that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. This therefore is a moſt ridiculous conceit, and likely to procéed from ſuch an idle head. Further, the ſame might be alleaged againſt Latine tranſlations. And yet <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> will not deny but the Church receiueth benefite by Latine tranſlations, albeit the Greekes, and ſuch as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Hebrew, and not Latin, receiue no benefite by the Latine tranſlation.</p>

                  <p>LIkewiſe the Papiſts to take from Chriſtians the effect and fruite of their prayers, ſet out moſt of their prayer bookes in Latine, and cloſely forbid the common ſeruice and

And this is alſo proued by the practiſe of the ſynagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> that alloweth the prayers of ſuch as pray in Latine, albeit like Parrots they vnderſtand not what they prattle: and by the teſtimonie of <hi>Hoſius, Bellarmine,</hi> and others writing vpon that argument.</p>
                  <p>But this practiſe is moſt barbarous, fruitleſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the cuſtome of Chriſt his Church in auncient time. <hi>Si neſciero virtutem vocis,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>1.

Secondly, that ſongs and prayers without vnderſtanding profit nothing. And laſtly, that it is ridiculous for the people to ſay Amen to the prieſt, when they vnderſtand not his prayer or bleſſing.</p>

But to what purpoſe if it were ſufficient, that the people ſhould be preſent onely, and not vnderſtand what is ſaid or praid?</p>
                  <p>This practiſe is clearely teſtified by <hi>Nicholas Lyra</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon the fourtéenth Chapter of the firſt to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians: In the primitiue Church bleſſings and other common things</hi> (viz. in the Liturgie) <hi>were in the vulgar tongues,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
                  <p>The aduerſaries alſo enforced by the euidence of truth, confeſſe, it were more profitable to haue prayers and the publike Liturgie of the Church, in tongues vnderſtood of the people, rather then otherwiſe: as may be gathered out of the words of <hi>Strabus, Lyra, Caietane,</hi> and others writing vpon the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians, chap. 14.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, reaſon maketh againſt the vſe of a tongue not vnderſtood in publike prayers. For if ſuch are condemned, as come neare to God with their lippes, hauing their hearts farre from him, then are not they to be allowed that in their prayers ioyne not their heart with their words.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Apoſtle ſheweth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> that it is a curſe laid v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon infidels, when God ſpeaketh to them in other tongues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the tongue ſeruing to vtter our conceipts, it is a moſt ridiculous thing for men to vtter things neither conceiued nor meant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> if the <hi>Romaines</hi> and <hi>Greekes</hi> in auncient time might vſe vulgar tongues in their publike Liturgies, why is not the ſame both lawfull and commendable now?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friar Robert Encont. 1. cap. 8.</hi> endeuoureth to ſhew rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the contrarie. But his reaſon is weak and friuolous. Comparing prayers with Scriptures, he ſaith, <hi>there is much leſſe neceſſitie of publike ſeruice in vulgar tongues.</hi> But if he had meant to defend the Popes cauſe and his owne, and to propound the ſtate of the controuerſie betwixt vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, he ſhould haue ſaid, that there is no profit, or vſe at all of vulgar tongues in the publike ſeruice in the Church, and that it is rather inconuenient and hurtfull, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For if it be profitable, and no way inconuenient, why ſhould not the publike Liturgie of the Church be in vulgar tongues?</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding let vs ſée, how he proueth that,<note place="margin">Warn-word. Encentr. 1. cap. 8.</note> which himſelfe propoundeth, albeit not the point in queſtion. Firſt he ſaith, <hi>that publike ſeruice is appointed to be ſaid or ſung to the praiſe of God, and in the name of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by publike Prieſts, and other eccleſiaſticall officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereunto.</hi> But if publike ſeruice be appointed to be ſaid, or ſong to the praiſe of God; then vnleſſe he exclude the people from the praiſes of God, the people alſo is to concurre with the Prieſts in prayſing of God, which they cannot do, vnleſſe they vnderſtand the language of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. But, I trow, he will not denie, but that the people ought to ioyne in ſinging Pſalmes, and giuing thankes to God in the open congregation. And therefore the Pſalme <hi>95. Come let vs ſing vnto the Lord,</hi> is commonly vſed in the beginning of Gods ſeruice, and the people in auncient Liturgies were wont oftentimes to anſwer the Prieſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is falſe, that publike ſeruice was appointed to be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18556:29"/> ſaid, and ſung onely by eccleſiaſticall officers, and that the people did not as well pray for things neceſſarie, as praiſe God for benefites receiued. But how could they do this, not knowing what they ſayd or prayed? If a man ſhould preſent himſelfe before the Pope and ſpeake ghibriſh, or a language not vnderſtood by the partie, would he not thinke himſelfe mocked?</p>
                  <p>He addeth further, <hi>that it is not needfull for the people to be alwaies preſent at publike ſeruice, but onely in ſpirit and conſent of heart.</hi> But the fellow doth plainely contradict himſelfe. For how can a man be preſent in ſpirit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of heart, when he is abſent with his vnderſtanding, and knoweth not what is done or ſaid? Beſide that, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth that, which he would proue. For if conſent of ſpirit and heart be requiſite in publike ſeruice, then is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite the people ſhould vnderſtand what is ſaid, without which vnderſtanding, he cannot conſent. Laſtly, if it be profitable, that the people be preſent in the congregation, where God is ſerued; that is ſufficient for vs to proue our aſſertion. For why ſhould not the people méete to celebrate the praiſes of God, being commaunded to kéepe his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths? And why ſhould they rather be enioyned to heare Maſſe, which is a profanation of Gods ſeruice, then to come to the Church, to praiſe God, and to pray vnto him, and to heare his holy word? And if the people ought to do this, then is it not ſufficient, that in time of ſeruice they ſhould gape on the Prieſt, or patter their <hi>Pater noſters,</hi> or <hi>Aue Mariaes,</hi> or rattle their beades, as the ignorant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes vſe to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he ſuppoſeth he can proue ſeruice in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue out of the ceremoniall law of <hi>Moyſes.</hi> For becauſe it is ſaid <hi>Luk. 1. That all the multitude of the people was praying without at the houre of incenſe</hi> while <hi>Zacharie</hi> offered incenſe within: he would inferre very willingly, that it is not neceſſarie, the people ſhould pray with the Prieſt in a tongue vnderſtood. But if this might be applyed to the Maſſe, then would it alſo follow, that the Prieſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18556:29"/> might offer the ſacrifice of the Maſſe without a Clerke, and the people attend without in the church yard. It would alſo follow, that the people might not heare, nor ſée Maſſe. For that the people might not enter within, nor ſée what was done in the ſanctuarie. Againſt vs this example fitteth not. For neither can any ſtrong argument be drawne from the ceremonies of the law, that are now abrogated, nor can <hi>Frier Robert</hi> ſhew, that the Prieſts of the law prayed in a tongue not vnderſtood, or that they vſed any publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which the people heard not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he alleageth, <hi>that the three learned languages of Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, were ſanctified by Chriſt in the title of his croſſe.</hi> But neither is he able to ſhew, why theſe thrée languages ſhould be called learned, rather then others; nor doth it follow, that in publike ſeruice we ſhould vſe only theſe thrée languages, becauſe they were vſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title of the croſſe, vnleſſe our aduerſarie will graunt, that it alſo followeth, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> rode vpon an aſſe, that he and his conſorts are onely to ride vpon aſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> he telleth vs, <hi>that auncient Fathers teſtifie, that it is not conuenient, that all things that are handled in Church ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, <hi>praeſertim in ſacris myſterijs,</hi> ſhould be vnderſtood by all vnlearned people in their owne vulgar languages.</hi> And to prooue this he citeth <hi>Dionyſius, Origen, S. Baſil, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, and Gregorie.</hi> But herein he ſheweth himſelfe a ſhameleſſe fellow, albeit all men knew it before. For none of theſe ſpeaketh one word againſt vulgar languages. Nay all of them ſhew, that the people vnderſtood the language of publike Liturgies. Againe, they deny not that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that the people ſhould vnderſtand the myſteries of Chriſtian religion, but rather ſhew the difficultie of it. But what is that to vulgar languages, when the Prieſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnderſtand not the myſteries of Chriſtian religion?</p>
                  <p>A ſixth argument he draweth from the practiſe of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſuppoſing that in <hi>Iurie</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the publike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice was in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and that <hi>Hebrew</hi> was not vnderſtood of the common people. But neither was publike ſeruice in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18556:30"/> all <hi>Syria</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as appeareth by the ſongs and prayers of <hi>Ephrem</hi> in the <hi>Syrian</hi> tongue, nor is it likely, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> did not vnderſtand <hi>Hebrew</hi> in Chriſts time, ſeeing now all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as it is ſaid, teach their children <hi>Hebrew.</hi> In <hi>Eſdras lib. 2. cap. 8.</hi> it appeareth they vnderſtood <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew. <hi>Intellexerunt verba quae docuerat eos.</hi>
                     </hi> They vnderſtood the words which he taught them. That therefore which is ſpoken of interpretation, is meant of the meaning and not of the words, as very ſimply our aduerſaries ſuppoſe.</p>
                  <p>His ſeuenth argument is taken from the example of the Apoſtles, <hi>that</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>appointed the order of ſeruice.</hi> But this ouerthroweth our aduerſaries cauſe. For if the Apoſtles neuer appointed the Maſſe, or the canon, or that ſeruice ſhould be ſaid in a tongue not vnderſtood, but rather ordained another forme of celebration of Sacraments, as I haue ſhewed in my bookes <hi>de Miſſa</hi> againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and if it be a matter cleare, that all ſhould be done decently in the Church and to edification; then is it not likely, that they would allow, or did appoint the ſeruice of God to be ſaid in a tongue not vnderſtood of the people, and very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood of moſt Prieſts. Here alſo he denyeth, <hi>That it can be ſhewed out of any author of antiquitie whatſoeuer, that any chriſtian Catholike countrie ſince the Apoſtles time had publike ſeruice in any language, but in one of theſe three,</hi> (viz. Hebrew, Gréeke or Latine) <hi>except by ſome ſpeciall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from the Pope, and vpon ſome ſpeciall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſome limited time.</hi> But firſt it maketh nothing for him, or againſt vs, if any nation had their ſeruice in <hi>Greek, Latine,</hi> or <hi>Hebrew,</hi> if the ſame vnderſtood the language of the publike Liturgie. For we onely ſay, that ſeruice ought not to be ſaid in a language not vnderſtood. Secondly, where he denyeth the vſe of all other tongues beſide theſe thrée, he ſheweth himſelfe either very ignorant, or very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent. If he haue not read auncient Fathers and hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, concerning the languages of publike Liturgies, he is but an ignorant nouice in this cauſe. If he know the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Church, and denie it, he wanteth ſhame.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:18556:30"/>
                  <p>That other tongues haue bene vſed in publike Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies beſide the thrée mentioned, it may be proued by diuers teſtimonies. <hi>Hierome</hi> in the funerall Sermon of <hi>Paula,</hi> ſaith that Pſalmes were ſung not onely in Hebrew, Gréeke and Latine, <hi>but alſo in the Syrian language.</hi> In his Epiſtle to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liodorus</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that the languages and writings of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do ſound foorth Chriſt his paſſion and reſurrection. <hi>Nunc paſſionem Chriſti, &amp; reſurrectionem eius cunctarum gentium &amp; voces, &amp; literae ſonant.</hi>
                     </hi> And againe in his Epiſtle to <hi>Marcella: <hi>Vox quidem diſſona, ſed vna religio: tot penè pſallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium chori, quot gentium diuerſitates.</hi> The tongue is diuers, but one religion: there be ſo many quires of ſingers, as there be diuerſities of nations.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>His eight argument is deduced from the vſe of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18556:31"/> Greeke, and Latine tongues in <hi>Aſia, Africke,</hi> and the Weſterne countries. But vnleſſe he can ſhew that theſe tongues were not vnderſtood of thoſe people that had their publike ſeruice in them; all this maketh for vs, and not for him. For we do not deny the vſe of theſe tongues to thoſe that vnderſtand them, but onely thinke it madneſſe to vſe them, where they are not vnderſtood. In <hi>Aſia</hi> the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue was common to moſt nations. Therfore the ſeruice was in <hi>Greeke</hi> and not in <hi>Latine,</hi> albeit <hi>Parſons</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> to be a ſanctified tongue. In <hi>Africke</hi> and diuerſe We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne countries, <hi>Latine</hi> was a common language in time paſt: and therefore they had their liturgies in <hi>Latine</hi> and not in <hi>Greeke.</hi> It appeareth by <hi>S. Auguſtine <hi>retract. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 20</hi> that diuers vnderſtood <hi>Latine</hi> better then the <hi>Punike</hi> tong: and <hi>Cicero <hi>pro Archia</hi>
                     </hi> ſayth, that the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue was a common language in his time. Although therefore the publicke ſeruice of the Church was in <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> when thoſe tongues were beſt vnderſtood, yet it followeth not that the ſame ſhould be ſtill vſed, when no man of the vulgar ſort vnderſtandeth them: or that the Catholicke Church did generally, or euer practiſe this: or that <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine <hi>lib</hi> 4. <hi>cont. Donatiſt. cap.</hi> 24.</hi> doth intend to ſpeake for the vſe of vnknowne languages, as <hi>Fryer Robert</hi> vnlearnedly and blockiſhly pretendeth.</p>
                  <p>Finally he alleageth, <hi>that euery man lightly vnderſtandeth ſomewhat of the Latine.</hi> But lightly he telleth vs a loud lie, as experience may teach euery man that is not obſtinate. Beſide that, if it be profitable for ſome men to vnderſtand ſome few words, then reaſon will inferre, that it were far more profitable, if the publike ſeruice were in a tongue that might of all the hearers be vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore a great bleſſing that we may heare God ſpeaking vnto vs in ſcriptures in our owne mother tongue, and praiſe and honor him with heart and voyce in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like congregation. If then <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> meane to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his owne opinion, and to ouerthrow our cauſe, he muſt bring better arguments, &amp; anſwer theſe teſtimonies,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18556:32"/> and not fight with his owne ſhadow, or cauill with ſome words, or allegations that are not materiall.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the great deliuerance of Chriſtians out of the bloudie hands of wooluiſh Papiſtes wrought by Queene Elizabeth.</head>
                  <p>No man can wel eſteeme what fauor God hath done the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by deliuering the ſame from the cruell perſecution of the bloudie and mercileſſe Papiſts, but ſuch as either themſelues ſuffered, or elſe knew the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and vexations of their brethren in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> time. Neither do any ſo well apprehend Gods mercie in deliuering them from the dangers of the ſea, as thoſe that haue either paſſed great ſtormes, or eſcaped after ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, ſéeing their fellowes ſwallowed in the ſea. But thoſe that liued in the dayes of Quéene <hi>Mary,</hi> and eſcaped the crueltie of thoſe times, or elſe by report know the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reſolution of the wooluiſh perſecutors, both well know the fauor of God to the Church and Engliſh nation, and can not chooſe but ſhew them ſelues thankefull for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The bloudy inquiſitors neither ſpared old nor yong, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor baſe, learned nor ſimple, man nor woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he were ſuppoſed to be contrary to their procéedings. The records of Marian Biſhops offices, are ſo many teſtimonials of their extreme crueltie. Neither was any free from danger, if any quarrell could be picked to him for religion. Thoſe that were ſuſpected, were impriſoned and hardly handled, ſuch as recanted were put to penance, thoſe that confeſſed the faith conſtantly, loſt life and all they had. As <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine <hi>lib.</hi> 22. <hi>de ciuit. Dei cap.</hi> 6.</hi> ſaith of the Primitiue Church, ſo may we ſay of the Chriſtian Martyrs of our time: <hi>Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur, includebantur, caedebantur, torquebantur, vrebantur: <hi>they were bound, put in priſon, beaten, racked and burnt.</hi>
                     </hi> The bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18556:32"/> deliuered vp his brother, and a mans domeſticals were his enemies. <hi>Euſebius lib. 2. de vita Conſtan. cap. 51.</hi> ſaith, That without reſpect of age all manner of torments were inflicted vpon the bodies of Chriſtians. <hi>Quae incendij flamma fuit,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quis cruciatus, quod tormentorum genus, quod non fuerit omnium ſanctorum corporibus nulla aetatis ratione habita irrogatum?</hi> The like may we ſay of the holy Martyrs of Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes. For neither hard dealing, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor fire was ſpared to draw men from the confeſſion of the true faith. Neither did the cruell aduerſarie reſpect the reuerend Prelates, nor the tenderneſſe of young age, nor the modeſtie of matrons.</p>
                  <p>But Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> coming to the crowne the fires were quenched, the ſwords were wreſted out of the cruell executioners hands, and true Chriſtians were not onely deliuered out of priſon and baniſhment, but alſo fréed from feare of perſecution. Therefore we ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Pſal. 139. Bleſſed be God, that hath not giuen vs as a prey into their teeth. Our ſoule is eſcaped as a ſparrow out of the ſnare of the fowler.

But all his ſpite is ſpent in two idle queſtions. Firſt he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>whether this freedome for perſecution be common to al, or to ſome onely:</hi> as if becauſe ſeditious Maſſe-prieſts and their traiterous conſorts, and other malefactors are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, this were no publike benefite, that all Chriſtians may fréely profeſſe religion. Secondly, he aſketh <hi>whether we be free from perſecution paſſiue or actiue:</hi> meaning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe murderers and traitors ſuborned to trouble the ſtate paſſe the triall of iuſtice, that we are perſecutors. But his exceptions do rather ſhew malice, then wit. For firſt albeit all men be not fréed from puniſhment, yet is it a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that true Chriſtians may profeſſe religion without feare or danger. For in <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great his time, murderers, and rebels, &amp; other notorious offendors were puniſhed; and yet doth <hi>Euſebius</hi> accompt the deliuerance of Chriſtians from perſecution a great benefite. If there had bene alſo then any Aſſaſſins, or traiterous Maſſe-prieſts ſuborned to kill Princes, or to raiſe ſedition, they ſhould haue bene executed: and yet could no man haue called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> a perſecutor. Let <hi>Parſons</hi> therefore, if he haue any ſhame, ceaſe to talke of perſecution, conſidering the bloodie maſſacres and executions committed by his conſorts vpon Chriſtians for méere matter of religion, and forbeare to tell vs, either of <hi>Penrie,</hi> or an hundred Prieſts put to death. For they were not called in queſtion for religion, but for adhering to the Pope and Spaniard, that went about to take the Crowne from her Maieſties head, and for going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by colour of their idolatrous Prieſthood to make a partie for the ayde of forraine enemies, as by diuers argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                  <p>THe Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> and his greaſie crew of pol-ſhorne Prieſts, although they challenge power of binding and looſing; yet as experience hath taught vs, do rather bind heauie burthens on mens ſhoulders, then bind their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and rather ſéeke to looſe and emptie their purſes, then to looſe them from their ſinnes. A man will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, what ſummes of money they haue extorted from all ſorts of men. But if we conſider the hookes, engines, and diuers practiſes, which they haue vſed to abuſe the world, we néed not make queſtion, but their dealings are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. The Popes haue made mony of licences to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to eate fleſh, or whit-meate, of diſpenſations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning benefices, of indulgences, of releaſing of Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, of delegating of cauſes, of collation of benefices, of deuolutions, of reſeruations, of prouiſions, of procurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the intricate rules of the Popes Chancerie, of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting priuiledges, of licences to kéepe concubines, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon whores, of annates, of contributions, of tenths, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Churches, of canonization of Saints, of caſes reſerued. Neither had they any law, or paſſed any act, but it was a meanes to make money. Likewiſe Maſſe-prieſts and Friars learning of their holy Father, ſold Maſſes, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and ſuch licences and faculties, as lay in their hand to grant. Neither would they do any thing without money. Monkes and Friars beſide buying and ſelling, had a moſt gainefull trade of begging. And ſuch was their ſhameleſſe dealing, that of the houſe of God they made a ſhoppe of merchandize, or rather a denne of théeues.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>England</hi> the Popes had a contribution called <hi>Peter pence:</hi> and yet not content therewith, or with the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie gaine of their faculties, annates, &amp; contributions, they impoſed extraordinarie ſubſidies as oft as themſelues li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.

But his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are ſuch, as may greatly confirme ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> yea. Firſt he ſaith, <hi>There hath not bene ſo many exactions in time paſt, as ſince the yeare 1530.</hi> and for proofe, he referreth vs vnto the exchequer bookes. But both his exceptions and his proofes are ridiculous. For albeit much hath bene paid to the king; yet it doth not therefore follow, that we are to pay much to the Pope. Againe, it is ridiculous to ſéeke proofes of the Popes exactions in the Exchequer bookes, being ſo many that they can hardly be regiſtred in any bookes. Beſide this it is falſe, that the people of <hi>England</hi> hath paid more to the king then to the Pope, as may appeare by the conference of particulars. But ſuppoſe we ſhould pay more to the king then to the pope: yet theſe two contributions are euill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together. For to the King we owe dutie and tribute, to the Pope we owe nothing, but many bitter execrations
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18556:35"/> for all our charges and troubles. For his malice is the root of all our troubles, and the cauſe of all our payments. He ſaith further, that notwithſtanding the exactions of the Pope, the Clergie in time paſt <hi>did farre excell our Clergie in eaſe and wealth.</hi> But that is no great commendation, if ours excell them in vertue and pietie. Beſide that, <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the third, doth in diuers places expreſſe the miſerable eſtate of the prelacie in thoſe times by reaſon of the Popes gréedineſſe. As for the common ſort of prieſts that liued vpon ſale of Maſſes, and the begging Fryers that liued vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> almes, <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> hath no reaſon to extol the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for wealth, &amp; leſſe certes for other qualities. But were our Clergy burthened more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in times paſt; yet hath this lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie companion no reaſon at all to mention the ſame, ſéeing the blame ariſeth from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sodomitical prieſthood of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſynagogue, that in king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his dayes ſold and intangled their liuings, and haue ſince bene occaſion of many troubles, which without charge could not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. He ſaith our Clergie may ſing, <hi>Beati pauperes ſpiritu:</hi> and ſo might the Romiſh Clergie too, if they were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> certes, himſelfe abuſing this place to ſport, as the Pope abuſeth ſcriptures to profite, ſheweth himſelfe to be an Atheiſt: and talking of his Clergie, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himſelf a ſot. For in the world there is not a more beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, I might alſo ſay bougerly Clergie, then in <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe which liue vpon the ſound of bels, &amp; by their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie voices, as Graſhoppers liue vpon dew, and ſing ſwéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oft times when they haue little to eate ſaue ſallades, and pottage of coleworts, and ſuch like ſuppes, and Italian <hi>Mineſtraes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterward turning his ſpéech from others, he runneth very rudely vpon me, and giueth out that I haue complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſecretly of heauy payments to prince and patron. But either he lyeth wilfully and wittingly againſt all truth and reaſon, or els ſome ſecret lying companion hath gulled him. Certes if he knew my eſtate, and how willing I haue bene and am, to ſpend more then ordinarie for reſiſtance both of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18556:36"/> common enemies, and ſuch Caniball traitors as himſelfe, he would not impute this vnto me. Let him therefore bring forth the man that told him this lie, or elſe he muſt be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with deuiſing the lie himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Finally he endeuoreth to excuſe <hi>Innocentius</hi> the fourth, and to lay the fault of the extreame exactions of his time rather vpon his collectors and officers, then vpon the Pope himſelfe. He pretendeth alſo, that <hi>Innocentius</hi> required a collection in a generall Councell. But who is ſo ſimple to thinke, that the whole ſtate would complaine of the court and Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> if the fault were onely in a few vſurers and caterpilling collectors? Againe, why ſhould <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> ſo often complaine of this, and other Popes for their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, if the fault were onely in the collectors? and why why did not the Pope ſometime puniſh his collectors abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their commiſſion? Thirdly it appeareth, that this cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging pope abuſed the world, pretending the recouery of the holy land, &amp; gathering great ſummes of money vnder that pretence, where it appeareth by the hiſtorie of <hi>Matthew Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and others, that he ſpent the money in warres to enrich his couſins and baſtards, and employed the aduenturers that croſſed themſelues for the holy land, againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and other Chriſtian ſtates. Finally it is a méere abuſe to call a rabble of idle Monkes and buſie Fryers, and ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Maſſe-prieſtes combined with Antichriſt a generall Councel, or to ſay that the Pope euer meant to recouer the holy land, or to enlarge Chriſtian Religion, ſéeing by his aſpires and contentions the <hi>Turkes</hi> haue enlarged, and Chriſtians haue loſt their Empire, being abandoned oft times and betrayed by the Pope.</p>

                  <p>Neither may we thinke, but that they had great reaſon thus to ſpeake, conſidering both the iniquitie of moſt of theſe conſtitutions, and the ſtrictneſſe of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by which men are bound to obſerue them. For what reaſon haue they either to prohibite mariage to any order, or ſtate of men, not prohibited by the law of God to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or elſe to reſtraine the libertie graunted by the lawe of God, or to forbid fleſh, egges, or milke vpon certain daies? Againe, why haue they brought in, not onely their carnall preſence of Chriſts bodie in the Sacrament, tranſſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, the idolatrous ſacrifice of the Maſſe, but their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, their indulgences, and infinite ſuch traſh? Why haue they abrogated Chriſts inſtitution in the celebration
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18556:37"/> of the Lords ſupper, not onely taking away the cuppe from the communicants, but making a priuate action of that, which ſhould be a communion? Is not this as much as the Phariſies did,<note place="margin">Mat 15.</note> that <hi>tranſgreſſed Gods commaundement for their owne tradition?</hi> And do not the Papiſts ordaine, that vnwritten traditions ſhould be receiued with equall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to the holy Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>Againe, what reaſon haue they to curſe and anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.</note> nay to put to cruell death, ſuch as obey not their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and vniuſt decrees? <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſaith: <hi>We haue but one Law-giuer, that is able to ſaue and deſtroy.</hi> And no where do we reade, that the Church of Chriſt did perſecute Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and put them death for matters of their conſcience and religion, much leſſe for matter of ceremonies, or ſuch obſeruances. Neither can the aduerſarie ſhew, that biſhops excommunicated Chriſtians, that would not rebell, and take armes againſt their Liege Soueraignes. <hi>Which of vs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Optatus, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Parmenian.</hi>) did perſecute any man?</hi> The Apoſtle he commaundeth euery ſoule to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to higher powers, and not to rebell. How vntolerable then are the <hi>Romiſh</hi> decretals and reſcripts, that not onely bind mens conſciences in things frée otherwiſe, but alſo in things, that may not be done without impietie?</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe haue diuers complained of the abuſe of popiſh excommunications. That which our Sauior Chriſt ſaith: <hi>If he heare not the Church, let him be to thee, as a heathen man or Publican,</hi> that the popiſh faction tranſlateth to the ridiculous cenſure of the Pope. And therefore excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth al that place not the Churches vnwritten traditions in equall rancke with diuine Scriptures; or that beléeue not, that <hi>Chriſtians can performe the lawe perfectly, and are iuſtified before God by the workes of the law:</hi> or that hold not the doctrine of the Romiſh Church concerning their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Sacraments: or that do not worſhip Images, or that receiue not their doctrine of indulgences, and purgatorie, and all the hereſies and abhominations of the Pope: or that ſubmit not themſelues to his tyrannie: or that refuſe to pay
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18556:37"/> his annates or taxes, or whatſoeuer he and his ſuppoſtes require. Nay, they excommunicate the ſubiects, that rebell not againſt their lawfull Kings.

                  <p>THeſe things therefore conſidered, it cannot be denied but that her Maieſties godly reformation brought great profite to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Yet if we pleaſe to looke backe to the hereſies of the Papiſts, and to remember how they liued in hereſie, ſchiſme, ſuperſtition and idolatry, we ſhall the rather praiſe God for that great deliuerance of his Church, which he wrought by the meanes of our late Quéene. For hereſie and falſe doctrine is the bane and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Church. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> If an Angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſhould teach vs any other Goſpel or doctrine beſide that whith himſelfe had taught the <hi>Galathians,</hi>

                  <p>Let vs therfore ſee whether the Papiſts may not be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the aforeſaid crimes of teaching hereticall and falſe doctrine, and of long continuance in ſchiſme, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and idolatry.

                     <hi>S. Peter (2. Pet. 1.)</hi> compareth the ſcriptures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>to a candle ſhining in a dark place:</hi> they teach, that ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are darke and obſcure.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18556:39"/> plainely that there was no ſuch Pope for many ages in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Reade the Scriptures:</hi> theſe ſay directly to the vulgar ſort, reade not Scriptures in vulgar tongs without licence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S. Iohn</hi> teacheth vs, that ſinne is, <hi>whatſoeuer is contrary to the law:</hi> theſe teach, that many ſins there are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Gods law: viz. ſuch things as are contrary to the Popes law.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that concupiſcence is ſinne:</hi> theſe affirme the contrary. He ſaith, <hi>originall ſinne paſſed ouer al;</hi> they deny it. He ſaith no man is iuſtified by the workes of the law, they teach flat contrary.</p>
                  <p>The law directly prohibiteth the making of grauen ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to the end to bow down to them and to worſhip them. Theſe notwithſtanding make the images of the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie bow downe to them and worſhip them.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>(Coloſſ. 2.)</hi> ſpeaketh againſt the worſhip of Angels. They regard him not, but in humbleneſſe of mind inuocate and worſhip Angels notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Our Sauior inſtituting the holy Sacrament of his body and bloud, ſayd: <hi>Accipite, manducate: <hi>take, and eate;</hi>
                     </hi> and <hi>drink ye all of this.</hi> They ſay, ſacrifice and worſhip, and drink not all of this.</p>
                  <p>To rehearſe all their contradictions to the word of God, and to the Apoſtles doctrine, were too long for this ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, let theſe therefore ſerue for an introduction. Of their hereſies I haue before ſpoken. <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, hath ſet forth a new forme of faith, of which that may be ſaid, which <hi>Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> ſpeaketh to <hi>Conſtantius:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contra Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantium.</note> 
                     <hi>Quicquid apud te praeter fidem vna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt, perfidia, non fides eſt.</hi> Whatſoeuer this wicked Pope hath ſet forth beſide the faith of Chriſt, <hi>the ſame is perfidiouſnes, and not faith.</hi> Of this qualitie is his doctrine of Romiſh tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, of ſuperſtitious ceremonies, of the blaſphemous Maſſe, of purgatorie, of indulgences, of the fiue new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſacraments, and ſuch like doctrines.</p>
                  <p>That the Papiſts are by ſchiſme rent from the Catholike
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18556:40"/> and vniuerſal Church of Chriſt, it may be proued by diuers particulars. Firſt, Chriſts Church hath but one head, that is Chriſt Ieſus. But the Romiſh Church hath as many heads as Popes, and heads that teach doctrine both diuers and contrary to Chriſt our ſole head.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt his Church hath no other ſpouſe but <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> But the adulterous Romiſh ſynagogue ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>knowledgeth the Pope to be her ſpouſe, and therefore muſt needes haue as many ſpouſes as Popes, and be not <hi>Virgo,</hi> but <hi>Polygama;</hi> that is, <hi>one that hath many husbands or ſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Catholike Church is built vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> being the corner ſtone; and hath beſide this no other foundation. But the Romiſh Church acknowledgeth the Pope to be her foundation. Whereupon it followeth, that ſhe is ſometime without foundation, at leaſt during the vacancie of the popedome, and hath as many diuers foundations as Popes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the ſynagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> doth acknowledge the Pope to be her law-giuer, and iudge, &amp; that he hath power not onely to bind mens conſciences, but alſo to ſaue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy: which doth ſhew that ſhe deuideth her ſelfe from Chriſtes Catholicke Church, which for many ages after Chriſts time had no ſuch conceit.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the ſame doth rely no leſſe vpon traditions not written, and vpon the Popes determinations in matters of faith, then vpon the written word of God: which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church doeth not.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, this ſynagogue conſiſteth of a Pope, and his Cardinals, together with a rabble of Monkes, Fryers, and ſacrificing prieſts. But in the prime Catholicke Church, there was no ſuch ſtate, nor orders of men to be found.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the members of the Romiſh ſynagogue, are not onely deuided from the Catholike Church in doctrine, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, externall gouernement and fellowſhip, but alſo one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> differing from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18556:40"/> Monkes from begging Friars, the regular orders from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſts, one Doctor from another, and one Pope oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from another. If then Schiſmatickes be no true members of the Church as their Doctors teach; then are not the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> of the Church. Againe, if they differ from the Catholike Church, and among themſelues, then haue they long continued in Schiſme.</p>
                  <p>The nature and propertie of ſuperſtition doth ſhew the Papiſts to be alſo moſt ſuperſtitious. For if it be the nature and propertie of ſuperſtition, either to giue religious honor and worſhip to ſuch things, as are not capable of it, or elſe to worſhip God after humane deuiſes, and otherwiſe then he hath commanded; then do they groſſely offend in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But it is moſt notorious, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they groſly offend in both thoſe points. For firſt they inuocate Angels. On the feaſt of <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangell they ſay: <hi>Holy S. Michael defend vs in battell, that we periſh not in the fearefull iudgement.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Miſſal. Rom.</note> They pray alſo to the Angell that kéepeth them, whom they know not: and this adoration of Angels in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catechiſme is allowed, if not commaunded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> they worſhip the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Mariali.</note> and call her <hi>the mother of grace, and port of ſaluation. Bernardin</hi> doth call her <hi>the mediatrix betwixt God and vs, and the helper of our iuſtification and ſaluation.</hi> They pray vnto her for helpe, <hi>per amorem vnigeniti filij cui,</hi> as if Chriſt were a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs and our Ladie.<note place="margin">In Pſalterio Bonauent.</note> 
                     <hi>Bonauenture</hi> tranſforming the Pſalmes which are made to be ſung in praiſe of God, to our Ladie, ſaith, <hi>Cantate Dominae, canticum nouum:</hi> and <hi>lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date dominam in ſanctis eius:</hi> that is, <hi>Sing to our Ladie a new ſong,</hi> and <hi>praiſe our Ladie in her Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they worſhip and call vpon other Saints beſide the holy Virgin, and attribute diuers Saints to diuers ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and countries, as thrée kings to <hi>Colleine, S. Ambroſe</hi> to <hi>Millane, George</hi> to <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>England, Andrew</hi> to <hi>Scotland, Iames</hi> to <hi>Spaine.</hi> They do ſuppoſe alſo, that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> doth helpe Mariners, <hi>Luke</hi> painters, <hi>Criſpine</hi> ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, that <hi>S. Anthonie</hi> cureth pigges, <hi>S. Gal</hi> géeſe, and <hi>S. Sebaſtian</hi> the plague. In the Romane Miſſall blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18556:41"/> they tranſlate the honour of our Sauiour to <hi>Leo</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaying to <hi>Leo, Thou art a prieſt for euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of Melchiſedech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they pray to things that cannot heare, not helpe, ſaying, <hi>O holy croſſe helpe me:</hi> and to the holy nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, <hi>Sancte Sudari or a pro nobis: <hi>O holy napkin pray for vs.</hi>
                     </hi> And againe, <hi>Sudarium Chriſti liberet nos à peſte, &amp; morte tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti.</hi> So the Papiſts of <hi>Cahors</hi> in <hi>France</hi> pray, and ſaluting the picture of Chriſts face called <hi>Veronica,</hi> they ſay: <hi>Haile holy face printed in a cloth:</hi> as if a good part of their religion were printed in linnen cloth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> they worſhip diuers men departed, of whoſe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, or percaſe being, they haue no certaintie: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>S. Catherine, S. Chriſtopher, S. George</hi> that fought with the dragon, <hi>S. Dominicke, S. Francis,</hi> and a multitude of other Monkes and Friars liker to be in hell then in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Whereof the common prouerbe ariſeth, <hi>That many are called vpon as Saints in heauen, whoſe ſoules are farre more likely to be tormented in hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, they giue diuine worſhip to the croſſe, and to the images of the holy Trinitie, worſhipping creatures for their Creator. They do alſo worſhip rotten bones, not knowing whether they be the relickes of Saints, or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men. They kiſſe them, bow, and burne incenſe vnto them. They worſhip ſwords, whippes, nailes, the aſſes taile whereon Chriſt rode, as they ſay, the bréeches of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> and diuers ragges, which God knoweth, from whence they came.</p>
                  <p>They practiſe alſo diuers falſe formes of worſhip, of which we may ſay, <hi>who hath required theſe things at their hands?</hi> The Ladies pſalter is a forme, that God neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. Many of their prayers are moſt blaſphemous. <hi>In hortulo animae</hi> printed <hi>anno 1565.</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> by one <hi>Merlin,</hi> they pray thus: <hi>O veneranda Trinitas, Ieſus, Ioſeph, &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, quam coniunxit diuinitas charitatis concordia:</hi> that is, <hi>O venerable Trinitie, Ieſus, Ioſeph, and Marie, which God hath conioyned with the concord of charitie.</hi> Neuer certes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18556:41"/> did the Prophets and Apoſtles teach vs ſo to pray, as is contained in the Breuiaries.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they ſay Maſſes in honor of Saints and of our Ladie, and make vowes vnto them. But our Sauiour Chriſt neuer taught vs to celebrate the Euchariſt in honor of Saints, or to offer his bodie in honor of <hi>S. Francis, Saint Cuthbert, S. Andrew,</hi> and other he and ſhe Saints.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the holy Prophets and Apoſtles neuer taught vs, that men are ſaued by eating ſaltfiſh and cockles, and forſwearing mariage, and ſuch like obſeruances, in which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> put great holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God neuer commaunded any to whip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to weare rings of iron, or woollen next our ſkinne, nor ſignified, that theſe things pleaſed him. Nay, the Apoſtle <hi>(Coloſ. 2.)</hi> condemneth ſuch obſeruations, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit hauing a ſhew of wiſedome, in ſuperſtition, humilitie and not ſparing the bodie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, our Sauiour neuer taught his diſciples to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſe ſalt and water to driue away diuels,<note place="margin">Miſſal Rom. in fine.</note> nor to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate paſchall Lambes, and candles, and ſuch like, as the Papiſtes do, preſcribing certaine formes thereof in their Miſſals, and ſaying ouer ſalt, <hi>Exorcizo te creatura ſalis, per Deum viuum, per Deum verum.</hi> That is: <hi>I exorciſe thee, thou creature of ſalt, by the liuing God, by the true God:</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t efficiaris ſal exorcizatum in ſalutem credentium: <hi>that thou maiſt be made coniured ſalt, for the ſaluation of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
                     </hi> Ouer the water they ſay: <hi>Exorcizo te creatura aquae, &amp;c. vt fias aqua exorcizata ad effugandum omnem poteſtatem inimici.</hi> That is: <hi>I exorciſe thee thou creature of water, &amp;c. that thou maiſt be made exorciſed water, to driue away all the power of the enemie.</hi> In bleſſing of the paſchall lambe they pray, <hi>that God would bleſſe and ſanctifie the creature of fleſh, which they deſire to receiue to the praiſe of God.</hi> Al which be tricks of notorious ſuperſtition. I forbeare to ſpeake of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious toyes of the Maſſe in croſſing, turning, knocking, waſhing, formes of habits and ſuch like ceremonies, for that they require a whole diſcourſe by themſelues.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:18556:42"/>
                  <p>It reſteth onely now, that I declare the Papiſts to of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fend in idolatrie, becauſe notwithſtanding their manifold abuſes in Gods worſhip, they obſtinately deny themſelues to be guiltie therein. But whatſouer pretences they bring they ſhall neuer be able to excuſe themſelues. For firſt it is notorious, and the aduerſaries will not denie, but that all thoſe are ſuperſtitious Idolaters, that giue the honour, which is properly due vnto God, vnto creatures. <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſum eſt</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine lib. 2. de doctr. Chriſt. cap. 20.) <hi>quicquid inſtitutum eſt ab hominibus ad facienda &amp; colenda idols, pertinens vel ad colendum, ſicut Deum, creaturam, partémue il<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lam creaturae, vel ad conſultationes &amp; pacta quaedam ſignificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num cum daemonibus placita &amp; foederata.</hi>
                     </hi> He ſaith, it is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, <hi>whatſoeuer is ordained of men for making and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping idols, pertaining either to the worſhip of creatures, or any part of a creature, as God, or elſe to magicall conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or couenants agreed vpon with diuels, for reuealing of matters. Thomas Aquinas 2.2. q. 94. art. 1.</hi> confeſſeth <hi>that idolatrie is nothing elſe, but the worſhipping of creatures either in viſible formes, or otherwiſe with diuine honour.</hi> And this is partly prooued out of the law of God againſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, which not only prohibiteth the hauing of ſtrange Gods, but alſo the making of grauen images, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bow vnto them, and to worſhip them. But the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Papiſts do worſhip the Sacrament as God, and call it their <hi>Lord and God.</hi> They do alſo giue Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the images of the Trinitie, of the Crucifixe, and croſſe, and teach, that what worſhip is due to the originall, is due to the image or picture, as <hi>Alexander Hales, p. 3. q. 3. art. vlt. Aquinas part. 3. q. 25. art. 3. and Caietan</hi> in his Commentaries vpon him do teſtifie. They do alſo make vowes to our Ladie and to Saints, and truſt very much in them. They do further call vpon Angels and Saints in all places, and offer ſacrifices in their honour. Finally, they bow vnto the images of Angels and Saints, pray before them, kiſſe them, and burne incenſe vnto them. All which be points of that adoration, that is due to God.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:18556:42"/>
                  <p>Secondly, they commit thoſe faults, which the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do note and condemne in idolaters of old time. They worſhip creatures for the Creator, as the Apoſtle <hi>Rom. 1.</hi>

Stephen</hi> maketh mention, <hi>Act. 7.</hi> They ſerue <hi>the hoaſt of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as the old idolatrous Iews ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Amos 5. &amp; Act. 7.</hi> ſeruing diuers ſaints, and as they call them, <hi>Militiam &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam coeleſtem:</hi> that is, <hi>the ſoldiory and court of heauen.</hi> As the ſtatues of the Gentiles <hi>were ſiluer and gold, the worke of mens hands, and had mouthes and ſpoke not, eies and ſaw not,</hi> as ſayth the Prophet, <hi>Pſal. 114.</hi> ſo is it with the images of Papiſts, that albeit of coſtly matter and curious worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, yet neither ſpeake with their mouthes, nor ſée with their eyes. As idolaters burnt incenſe to their ſtatues, as we reade <hi>2. Paral. 30.</hi> ſo do Papiſts burne incenſe to their images.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they fall into thoſe abuſes, which the Fathers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church thought worthy to be reprehended of old time, as ſauoring of idolatry. The Gentiles thought they could repreſent God in a materiall image. And ſo do the Papiſts making the image of God the Father, and God the holy Ghoſt. The Fathers therefore reprehend them both alike. <hi>Quis tam amens erit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Euſebius praeparat.

                  <p>Fourthly, they muſt néedes deny the croſſe, and the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Trinitie, and the crucifixe to be creatures and works of their owne hands, or elſe in worſhipping of them, they muſt needes confeſſe and yéeld themſelues to be idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But that they cannot do.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the teſtimonie of their owne conſcience doth proue them to be idolaters, in that they leaue out the ſecond commandement, or as they make it, a péece of the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that is direct againſt the adoration and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of grauen images, and the making of them to that end, in moſt of their Catechiſmes, Manuals, Pſalters, and ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bookes, where they rehearſe the ten commandements, as their Ladies pſalters, ſhort Catechiſmes, and diuers of their bookes do teſtifie.</p>

                  <p>THe Miniſters of God, as they are guides to their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and teachers of the law; ſo ought they to go before their flockes, ſhewing them examples to prouoke them to do good workes, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme their liues according to the lawes of God. <hi>Shew thy ſelfe an example of good workes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit 2.</note> ſayth <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. Epheſ. 2.</note> All true Chriſtians alſo ſhould ſhew themſelues zealous of good workes. For <hi>we are Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, created in Chriſt to good workes, which God hath ordained that we ſhould walke in them.</hi> This is our doctrine, and the practiſe of all that profeſſe our religion. If any hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites be found among vs, that walke not according to their profeſſion, we renounce them, we weed them out, we puniſh them. If worldlings and fleſhly Papiſts, that liue in the Realme do giue occaſion of offence, this ought not to be imputed to our Religion, nor the true profeſſors thereof, that deſire nothing more then that ſuch may be weeded out, and expulſed both out of the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                  <p>But if we looke backe to former times, we ſhall find that the Papiſts haue not onely erred in the practiſe, but alſo in the doctrine of good workes. For firſt they denie, that the law of God is a perfect rule of life. And therefore haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented other rules, whereby they hope to attaine to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfection. Secondly they hold, that by the law of God we haue not knowledge of all ſinnes, teaching that it is as well mortall ſinne to tranſgreſſe the Popes lawes, as to tranſgreſſe Gods lawes, as <hi>Nauarrus</hi> teacheth vs in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall by many particulars. Thirdly, they giue abſolution to euery haynous ſinner, confeſſing his ſins, before he hath repented. Fourthly, they ſuppoſe that euery man is able to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18556:44"/> ſatiſfie for the temporall penaltie of ſinnes, and that the Pope hath power by his indulgences to remit ſinnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the penaltie without ſatiſfaction. Fiftly, they teach that no man néedeth to repent for veniall ſinnes, and that ſuch ſinnes exclude vs not out of the kingdome of heauen. Sixthly they teach, that man is able perfectly to fulfill the law, and by a good conſequent to abſtaine from all ſinne, which <hi>S. Hierome</hi> declareth to be <hi>Pelagianiſme.</hi> Seuenthly, they hold contrary to the Apoſtle, <hi>that man is to be iuſtified by the workes of the law,</hi> and that eternall life is to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by our owne workes and merites.</p>
                  <p>Many other falſe points of doctrin they haue beſide theſe. But their practiſe is farre worſe then their doctrine. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the weightier points of the law, like their anceſters the Phariſees they ſtand much on tithing Mint, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and waſhings, &amp; ſuch like ceremonies. Their principall works are forſwearing of mariage, begging like vagabond fellowes, eating muſcles, cockles, and ſalt fiſh, and ſuch like on faſting dayes, and ſaints vigiles, taking aſhes on Aſh-wedneſday, confeſſing in a prieſts eare at Shroftide, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of crownes, going to Maſſe, ſprinkling of holy-water, lighting of candles at noone day, crouching to images, crée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to the croſſe, kiſſing of the Popes toe, praying for ſoules in purgatorie, gaining of pardons, going on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, ringing and ſinging for the dead, aneling and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of men and women deſperately ſicke, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>The Popes, Cardinals, Maſſe-prieſts, Monkes &amp; Friers, care neither much for theſe ceremonies, nor for other good workes. If any of them, or their adherents haue a ſhew of godlineſſe; yet they haue denied the power thereof. If they do build ſchooles or hoſpitals, or giue largely, it is for the maintenance of their ſtate, and to winne glorie and praiſe of men. The liues and actions of moſt of them, are moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable.

Euery where men ſet vp bankes of vſurie: all things are defiled with moſt foule vices of the fleſh, and moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſodomie. Pride in pompous ſhewes haue now filled cities and countries: blaſphemies againſt God, periuries, lies, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, violence, orpreſſion of the poore, and ſuch like vices do ſuperabound.</hi> I would further inſiſt vpon this argument, but that I referre diuers matters ouer to the ſecond booke, where I ſhall haue occaſion more particularly to examine the good workes of Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>But the Church of <hi>England</hi> neither alloweth publike ſhewes, nor bankes of vſurie, nor diſpenſeth with oathes of ſubiects to Princes, or alloweth periurie, nor ſhall <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Parſons</hi> find ſuch filthines and abhominations among the profeſſors of our religion, as are commonly practiſed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes, Cardinals, Maſſe-prieſts, Monkes, Friars, and Nuns, and their followers. All corruptions in doctrine concerning good workes are reformed, and diuers abuſes concerning manners among the Papiſts taken away. The which ſéeing it procéeded wholly of that reformation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which Quéen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of pious memorie wrought by her regall authoritie among vs, we are moſt gratefully to accept that worke, and by exerciſes of pietie and charity to indeuour to ſhew our ſelues not vnworthie either of our profeſſion, or of ſo great a bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this diſcourſe <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> talketh very ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and ſaith firſt, <hi>that the experience of the whole world will deny, that good workes are fruites of our religion.</hi> But
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18556:48"/> if he had bene well aduiſed, he would haue forborne to talke of experience. For whoſoeuer hath liued among thoſe, that are of our religion, and among Papiſts alſo, muſt néedes ſay, that the liues of Romaniſts are abhominable, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in whoredome, Sodomie periurie, vſurie and all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, and diſcharge vs deterring and abhorring thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and puniſhing them ſeuerely. Beſide that, if he meant to winne credit, he would not talke of the whole world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to name one honeſt man, that will iuſtifie that which he talketh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he ſaith, <hi>our beſt friends renounce our workes.</hi> And then alleageth an Epiſtle of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> mentioned by <hi>Surius,</hi> &amp; a Poſtil of <hi>Luther,</hi> and a teſtimonie out of <hi>Aurifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> But firſt <hi>Eraſmus</hi> is none of our beſt friends, being in moſt points an aduerſarie, and a profeſſed Maſſe-prieſt. And if he were our friend, yet haue we no reaſon to beléeue <hi>Surius</hi> a malicious enemie, and a baſe Monke, hired to ſpeake lyes. Secondly, it is a ridiculous foolerie, where we diſpute of the fruites of the Goſpell in <hi>England</hi> in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, to bring teſtimonies of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faber,</hi> that were dead before her time, and ſpeake of ſome of their countrie people. Thirdly, they ſpeake not of the whole reformed Church in <hi>Germanie,</hi> but rather of ſome that albeit they diſliked Poperie, yet did not ſincerely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth. Finally, neither <hi>Luther</hi> nor <hi>Aurifaber</hi> doth charge his countrie people with ſuch faults, as raigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Papiſts. He muſt therfore ſéek ſome witneſſes that ſpeake more to purpoſe, and leaue his owne treaſons, filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, periurie, lying, gluttonie, and drunkenneſſe, before he talke of good workes.</p>
                  <p>Finally, he pratleth much concerning the merit of workes. But if he had bene vſed according to his merits, then had the crowes long ere this eaten his carion fleſh. He miſliketh alſo, that we ſhould giue a caueat, <hi>to auoide hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall oſtentation,</hi> albeit any man ſhold do good works. But this caueat concerneth him but a litle, whoſe workes are moſt wicked and odious, his writings being nothing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18556:49"/> but either lying and rayling libels, or fond and trifling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of points of Poperie, and his practiſes tending all to murdering, empoyſoning, ſedition, warre, and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>

                     <hi>albeit we ſhould hazard our liues.</hi> And again, <hi>Ita praeclara eſt recuperatio libertatis, vt ne mors quidem ſit in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertate
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18556:49"/> repetenda, fugienda. <hi>So excellent is the recouerie of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, that we are not to doubt to loſe our liues for the regai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof.</hi>
                     </hi> Contrariwiſe, it is an indignitie not to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by any Engliſhman honorably minded, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould raigne ouer vs. The Spaniſh gouernment is very rigorous in <hi>Spaine:</hi> but in <hi>Flanders, Millan, Naples</hi> and the <hi>Indiaes</hi> the ſame is moſt tyrannicall and intolerable. Seing then that by the happie entrance of Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt their footing in <hi>England,</hi> which they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie deuoured in their imagination, and both perfidious <hi>Marans,</hi> and the Popes bougerly <hi>Italians</hi> were turned out to ſéeke new countries, wherein to practiſe their fraud and crueltie: why do we not continually renew our thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for ſo great deliuerance?</p>
                  <p>Her Maieſtie was alwaies deſirous of peace, and neuer made warres againſt any, but being prouoked, and forced thereunto for the defence of her eſtate and people. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did ſhe take armes in hand, but ſhe returned with victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The <hi>French</hi> entring into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by that meanes intending to trouble <hi>England,</hi> were forced to ſurrender <hi>Lieth,</hi> and with ſcorne to returne from whence they came. Vpon which great ſecuritie enſued to both the countries.</p>
                  <p>When the Nobilitie and people of <hi>Fraunce</hi> were oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Popes faction, that meant after they had atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their purpoſe there, to aſſaile vs in England, (as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Treatiſes they haue declared) by her armes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation the Chriſtians there obtained good conditions of peace, if the aduerſaries perfidiouſly had not broken them. Both with forces in <hi>New-hauen,</hi> and by other meanes ſhe was alwaies willing to ſuccour that diſtreſſed people.</p>
                  <p>By her ſupport for the moſt part, the ſtates of the lowe countries being in danger to be depriued of their libertie, priuiledges and lawes, and to be tyrannized by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> haue long ſubſiſted, and maintained themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt moſt cruell enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno Dom. <hi>1588.</hi>
                     </hi> that fléete of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which proudly they called <hi>the inuincible Armada,</hi> by her ſhippes through
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18556:50"/> Gods fauour was chaſed, diſperſed and vanquiſhed, and all the bragges of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their aſſiſtants brought to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, when ſhe ſaw, that to reſiſt the enemies malice it was neceſſarie for her to follow the warres, ſhe ſent ſome forces to ſea, which albeit not great nor compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently prouided, yet did they poſſeſſe the harbor of <hi>Coronna</hi> take the baſe towne, and defeat all the forces that were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered againſt them at the bridge of <hi>Burgos.</hi> The ſame alſo entred <hi>Portugal,</hi> and had poſſeſſed it, if there had bene good correſpondence. <hi>Sir Francis Drake</hi> with no great forces took <hi>S. Iago, S. Domingo, S. Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and laid a plot to take a great part of the <hi>Indiaes</hi> from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> but that he defended himſelfe with bribes better then with ſhippes or armes, corrupting ſome that alwaies ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw moſt traiterouſly all attempts againſt him.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Caliz</hi> her Maieſties ſouldiers burnt the kings fléete, tooke the towne, and had entred farther into the countrie, had not the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſome as good friends in our armie, as the Quéene.</p>
                  <p>Not long ſince the Engliſh together with the States ſouldiers ouerthrew the Cardinals armie betwéene <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> and <hi>Oſtend,</hi> to the vtter ouerthrow of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in that countrie, if the victorie had bene purſued. And now albeit coldly purſued, yet hath it ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his forces, that he hath lien idlely euer ſince before <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend,</hi> hoping rather by treatie, then by force to preuaile.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Ireland</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> ouerthrew the Earle of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and cut the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that kept the fort at <hi>Smerwike,</hi> in péeces. About y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time alſo died <hi>Sanders</hi> the Popes Legate, and other traitors ſtirred vp to rebellion by the Pope and his agents.</p>
                  <p>Neither could <hi>D. Iuan d'Aquila</hi> kéepe his footing in <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi> albeit he had with him many good ſouldiers and great aduantages. Diuers times hath the Pope troubled her both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſtirring vp firſt the Earles of <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and then certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18556:50"/> in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and afterward procuring diuers ſeditious fellowes in <hi>Ireland</hi> in hope of his bleſſing to rebel. But his bleſſings haue bene turned into curſings, and all his treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deuiſes haue come to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Finally, we find Gods promiſe to his people by <hi>Moyſes Deut. 28.</hi> verified in her. For where he ſayth, <hi>That God would make all his peoples enemies to fall down before them,</hi> we ſée that all the Quéenes enemies fel before her, and that the more they maligned her, the more God aduanced her. Such reputation ſhe wan both with Chriſtians and with Infidels, that al men had great reſpect vnto her, except ſuch as maliciouſly oppugned her. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the <hi>Tranſiluanian</hi> haue receiued fauour of the <hi>Turk</hi> for her ſake, and her friends great comfort in all their diſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>Before the Quéenes time the Pope claimed a great part in the gouernement of <hi>England,</hi> challenging power to make Eccleſiaſtical lawes, to ſend hither Legates, to ordaine and appoint Biſhops, &amp; in diuers caſes to diſpoſe of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call liuings, and thoſe that poſſeſſed them. He did alſo leuis tenths and firſt fruites, and by procurations, licences and diſpenſations drew great ſummes of money out of the realme. In ſome caſes he tooke vpon him to iudge the king, and to diſpoſe of the crown of <hi>England.</hi> Hereof it followeth firſt, that the Kings of this land for ſome ages before King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, were but halfe Kings, neither medling with the externall gouernement of the Church, nor being authorized to rule their Cleargie, or to diſpoſe of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings. Secondly, that they held that poore halfe of their kingdome, which remained at the Popes pleaſure, and no further, as appeared by the inſolent dealing of the Pope with King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and King <hi>Iohn,</hi> out of whoſe hands the Pope had almoſt wreſted the ſcepter of their roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all authoritie. But her Maieſtie aboliſhing the vſurped po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Pope, fréed her ſelfe and her ſucceſſors from his tyrannie, and reſtored that power and iuriſdiction to the Crown, that was by his craft and fraudulent dealing long vſurped. She found that it belonged to godly kings to make
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18556:51"/> lawes for religion, to rule their ſubiects, to diſpoſe of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and goods of the Church according to right. So did <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, and other godly Emperors. So did <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and <hi>Lewes</hi> kings of <hi>France,</hi> So did <hi>Alfred</hi> and <hi>S. Edward</hi> Kings of <hi>England:</hi> as the lawes of the <hi>Code</hi> and <hi>Nouell conſtitutions,</hi> the conſtitutions of <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Lewes,</hi> and of the auncient Kings of <hi>England</hi> declare. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before Pope <hi>Heldebrand,</hi> or rather that firebrand of hell, did any Pope take vpon him to giue out lawes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals for the gouernement, either of the whole Church, or the Churches of other kingdoms. For this matter therfore Quéene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> name deſerueth to be had in perpetuall remembrance, for that ſhe fréed her ſelfe and her ſubiects from the Popes wicked lawes and vſurpations, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the auncient priuiledges and dignities to the Crowne. The which had bene much in a man, but in a woman was much more glorious.</p>
                  <p>With her alſo peace, which by the practiſes of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had bene exiled to our loſſe and ſhame, returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into this land. For finding this land at variance with <hi>France,</hi> and forſaken of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſhe found meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with <hi>France,</hi> and bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſettle matters at home. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophets admonition,<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhe ſought peace and followed it.</hi> And ſuch ſucceſſe hath it pleaſed God to giue her, that although the Pope by diuers practiſes hath ſought to raiſe diſcord and rebellion within <hi>England,</hi> yet maugre his head, we haue enioyed peace this fiue and fortie yeares to the great contentment of her ſubiects, and the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world. For who wondreth not that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> and other our neighbor countries being in a flame and the Pope deſiring nothing more then to ſet our country on fire, that the moderation of a woman ſhould maintaine her State in peace, when great Kings could not kéepe their ſtate from being conſumed with warres? How great this benefite is, both the commodities of peace and the miſeries of warres may teach vs. <hi>Et nomen pacis dulce eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tully, <hi>&amp; ipſa res ſalutaris.</hi>

                     <hi>that delighteth in ciuill diſcord and warre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By meanes of long peace, this land is alſo growne to great wealth. The country is better cultiuated, trade is much increaſed, all arts and occupations growne to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection then in time paſt. Noblemen and Gentlemen haue doubled their reuenues, Yeomen and Merchants aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to the degrée of Gentlemen, and diuers men of occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do exceed men of their ſort in former times. Whoſoeuer compareth the common people of <hi>England</hi> with men of their qualitie in <hi>Spaine, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> muſt néedes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that in wealth and meanes our country men do farre excéed them.</p>
                  <p>Finally, neuer was <hi>England</hi> ſo populous and ſtrong in men, as in our late Quéenes dayes. <hi>Spaine</hi> and moſt places of <hi>Italy</hi> ſéeme deſolate in compariſon. That theſe are great bleſſings, it cannot be denied. For God promiſeth increaſe of ſubſtance, and men, to his people as a bleſſing, <hi>Deut. 28. Bleſſed ſhall be the fruit of thy body,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moyſes</hi> to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God) <hi>and the fruite of thy land, the fruite of thy cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, the flockes of kine and ſheepe.</hi> And the multiplication of <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie, <hi>Gen. 17.</hi> and in diuers other places was accounted to him as a great bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore as oft as we looke backe to former times, we cannot chooſe but call to mind thoſe graces which we haue long enioyed by Quéene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> meanes, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto God for them. If any be either vnmindfull or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, if he be Engliſh, I doubt not but he will proue a traitor to his Prince and country; if a ſtranger, then he will
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18556:52"/> ſhew himſelfe an enemie. In the the firſt ranke I place <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Parſons,</hi> in the ſecond, certaine malicious <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Friers. But their diſcourſes, wherein they would denigrate her glorie, are ſo fond and friuolous, that they do rather illuſtrate the ſame.

For the relikes of thoſe large Prouinces were loſt not by Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but by that vnhappie woman Quéene <hi>Mary,</hi> and her bloudy and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly prieſts. Moreouer, if King <hi>Philip</hi> fell at variance with vs, the ſame was not the Quéenes fault, that kept good correſpondence with him, albeit he betrayed her to the French at her firſt comming to the crowne, and ſuccored the rebels of the North <hi>anno 1569.</hi> and conſpired with that louzie Frier <hi>Pius the fift</hi> to ouerthrow her. Neither haue we loſt any thing, but rather gotten by his falling from vs,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18556:52"/> being vnited to the Low countries, and able to maiſter him at the ſea, if the king of <hi>England</hi> will be pleaſed to follow his aduantage.</p>
                  <p>He chargeth her further with ſupporting <hi>rebels, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and obiecteth vnto her, <hi>familiaritie with the Turke.</hi> But neither ſhall this railing companion, and principall proctor of popiſh traitors, rebels, and atheiſts proue them rebels, whom ſhe hath ſuccoured: nor can the <hi>Spaniard</hi> iuſtly challenge her in this courſe, beginning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe firſt, and falling out with her for the Popes pleaſure. As for that contract which her Maieſtie had with the Turke, it was onely for trade of merchandiſe, as the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles will ſhew; and not for amitie. And yet if by this means ſhe had any credit with the <hi>Turke,</hi> ſhe vſed it to the good of Chriſtians, as the <hi>Polonians</hi> and <hi>Tranſiluanians</hi> can teſtifie. But king <hi>Philip</hi> ended his warres with the <hi>Turke</hi> to fight againſt <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And therefore no maruell, if vpon his death bed he confeſſed, that he neuer reaped other fruite of his trauell and expence, <hi>but ſorrow and loſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſhew that peace was no ornament of Quéene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> praiſe, he ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Encont. c. 11. nu. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>we haue had more ſtirres within this ſeuentie yeares,</hi> then in a thouſand yeares before. But he ſhould haue ſpoken of tumults and ſtirres in her raigne: for that is the time we ſpeake of. Againe, he ſhould haue declared, that theſe ſtirres haue procéeded from vs, and not from wicked Popes, that haue bene the firebrands to ſet all Chriſtendome on a flame. For if by wicked Popes, and their agents, rebellions were ſtirred in <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> and <hi>Lincolneſhire</hi> in king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his dayes, and in <hi>Cornewall</hi> and <hi>Deuonſhire,</hi> and other places in the raigne of king <hi>Edward,</hi> and in the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in Quéen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes; then are they to be charged for theſe diſorders, and not we. But ſuppoſe great ſtirres had bene raiſed before Quéene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time; yet that was her commendation, rather then diſgrace, that ſhe was able notwithſtanding the malice of traiterous Maſſe-prieſts, to gouerne her countries a long time peaceably, which her
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18556:53"/> aunceſtors could not.</p>
                  <p>He doth alſo talke very impudently <hi>of the patience of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: as if their mild and bearing natures, and not the Queens moderation, had bene cauſe of our long peace.</hi> But the ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the butcherly Prelates at the Quéenes firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Crown, the rebellion in the <hi>North, anno. 1569.</hi> the Norfolcian ſtirres, the practiſes of <hi>Allan</hi> with the duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> of <hi>Allan, Englefield,</hi> and diuers other traitors, with the Pope and <hi>Spaniard</hi> for an inuaſion, <hi>anno 1588.</hi> of <hi>Parſons</hi> and others <hi>1597.</hi> the conſpiracies firſt of <hi>Parrie,</hi> then of <hi>Throckmorton,</hi> then of <hi>Someruile</hi> and <hi>Arden,</hi> then of <hi>Ballard</hi> and <hi>Babington,</hi> and afterward of <hi>Lopez</hi> and <hi>Squire;</hi> and finally the maſſacres and bloudie warres in <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Flaunders</hi> do ſhew, that they neither are mild, nor patient, nor ſeek any thing elſe, but murder and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. If then any patience they haue had at any time, it is, as the French men ſay, <hi>the patience of Lombardes,</hi> that reſt when they cannot moue ſtirres. Furthermore it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the world, that the Quéene was wholy reſolued to follow peace, neuer taking armes, but when ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and refuſing to accept of the Low countries offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into her hands, becauſe ſhe would not intricate her ſelfe with warres, albeit ſhe might with great honour, and ſafety haue accepted them long before.</p>
                  <p>Hauing nothing to alleage againſt her Maieſties peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gouernement at home, he telleth vs, that ſhe hath had <hi>almoſt perpetual warre with all our neighbours round about vs.</hi> But neither doth he ſpeake truly, the attempts of <hi>New-hauen,</hi> and <hi>Lieth,</hi> being of ſhort continuance, and her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie not entring into the Low countries quarrell before the yeare <hi>1586.</hi> Nor to purpoſe, our diſcourſe concerning principally the Quéenes peaceable gouernment at home. Beſide this, the forces her Maieſtie employed in the Lowe countries were ſo ſmall, and the courſe ſo certaine, that the action doth ſcarce deſerue the name of warres, being with ſo litle trouble to our nation, and intended rather to reſiſt a few cut-throates, that ſought to murther men, then the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18556:53"/> of a king, that ſought with force to ſubdue a countrie by iuſt warres. As for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (whom <hi>Parſons</hi> ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly calleth <hi>our ſureſt allies,</hi> although they haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe dealt againſt vs, as perfidious enemies) they can not ſay, but the Quéene dealt iuſtly defending her ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt publike enemies, that ſought her deſtruction, and the ouerthrow of her people.</p>
                  <p>To proue that the land hath not increaſed in wealth in the late Quéenes time, he obiecteth,<note place="margin">1. Encountr. cap. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Nobilitie and Gentrie keepe not ſo great houſes, nor families, as in times paſt.</hi> But the witleſſe fellow ſpeaketh againſt himſelfe. For the leſſe is ſpent, the more remaineth. But that many are able to keepe as great houſes as in time paſt, it cannot be denyed. Further if he knew the ſtate of the countrie, he might know that many houſes are built and kept, where in time paſt there was neither houſe-kéeping nor houſe. He telleth vs further <hi>of tributes, and other duties.</hi> But his tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and dealing therein is but friuolous. For compare all that is paid in ſubſidies and other duties with former pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet is it not halfe of that, which was exacted by the Pope, and ſpent in ſuperſtition and vaine deuiſes. But were our ſubſidies greater; yet being beſtowed vpon our owne ſouldiers and people, the land is neuer a whit the poorer, but rather poore men employed by thoſe, that can well ſpare all which they giue, and more.</p>
                  <p>Finally, he would inſinuate, <hi>that increaſe of people</hi> is no bleſſing, ſéeing the <hi>Turkes</hi> by multitude of wiues haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children, and holy Eunuches are commended that haue no children. He doth alſo vnder hand glaunce at the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Miniſters. But firſt, he denyeth that, which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth directly teach, viz. that children are the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, and that God did promiſe the multiplication of his ſéede to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a great bleſſing. Secondly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit particular men that kéepe themſelues chaſt for the kingdome of heauen, are commended: yet that concerneth the lecherous and bougerly Maſſe-prieſts and Monkes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that rather forſweare mariage, then kéep themſelues
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18556:54"/> chaſt. Neither is that a commendation to a whole State or kingdome, if ſome liue chaſtly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, albeit <hi>Turkes</hi> haue many wiues: yet God doth not ſo bleſſe them with children, but that they are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to vſe the children of Chriſtians, and to exact a tribute of them. To conclude, this baſtardly fellow ſheweth himſelfe to be paſt ſhame, to talke againſt mariage, when himſelfe was begotten by a filthie prieſt, and his conſorts wallow in all beaſtly abhominations.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let the aduerſaries ſtorme and rage as much as they liſt, yet will we ſay, and may ſay it moſt truly, that both the Church of God and the State hath receiued great bleſſings by Quéene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> late happie gouernment. And if nothing elſe, yet the vaine oppoſition of enemies and traitors may perſwade vs, that it is ſo. For not onely their miſlikings do ſhew, that both the Church and State was well ordered, (for otherwiſe they would haue bene better pleaſed) but alſo their vaine ianglings and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, they being not able to obiect any thing, which ſoundeth not to her Maieſties honour and high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, confirme the ſame.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18556:54"/> vpon her in diuers libels. In his <hi>Warn-word</hi> that is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of his foolery, he ſayth, <hi>We receiued no bleſſings by her, but rather curſings.</hi> Here therefore we are to anſwer the barking of this curſed hel-hound, and of his accurſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt encounter of his <hi>Wardword p. 4.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>We are deuided from the general body of catholickes in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> But this ſhould haue bene proued if he would haue any man to giue him credit. For we alleage, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, from whom we are deuided, are no Catholikes, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the new doctrines of the late conuenticles of <hi>Lateran, Conſtance, Florence</hi> &amp; <hi>Trent,</hi> &amp; other Friers &amp; prieſts, which neither were receiued of all men, nor in all times, nor in all places, which is the true propertie of Catholicke doctrine. Next we offer to proue, that we are true Catholikes, ſéeing the doctrine of our faith is Apoſtolicall, and vniuerſally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of all true Chriſtians, and for the moſt part confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Papiſts, vntil of late time. If then this be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall curſe, <hi>to be deuided from Catholickes,</hi> then doth the ſame fall on <hi>Parſons</hi> his own head, and vpon his trecherous conſorts, and not vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly he ſaith, that we of <hi>England</hi> are deuided from <hi>Lutherans, Zuinglians,</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> abroad, and from <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> &amp; <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and other like good fellowes at home. But this common Iergon of Papiſts is already anſwered. For neither do we acknowledge the names of <hi>Lutherans, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians,</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts,</hi> nor can he ſhew that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is deuided from the Churches of <hi>France, Germanie</hi> or <hi>Suizzerland,</hi> or that one Church oppugneth another. If any priuate man do maintaine priuat opinions in doctrine, as diuers <hi>Germaines, French,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> do, or elſe if there be any difference among vs concerning ceremonies and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, that doth no more make a ſchiſme in our church, then the diuers rites of <hi>Spaniſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers opinions in al points of religion betwéen old and new Romiſh Doctors, maketh a ſchiſme in the Romiſh Church. For generally we all agrée in ſubſtance of faith, &amp; in rites &amp;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18556:55"/> ceremonies refer euery Church to their libertie. In <hi>England</hi> publikely there is more vniformitie in doctrine, prayers &amp; ceremonies, then in the Romiſh Church; albeit ſome priuat men, whom <hi>Parſons</hi> vſeth to call <hi>Puritanes,</hi> diſſent in ſome points. As among the Papiſts there are diuers that allow not all, which they hold commonly. But ſaith he in his <hi>Warne-word, <hi>Encont.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</hi> the <hi>French, Germaines</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> do not agrée with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the rule of faith, as is proued in the foure, fiue and ſixe and ſequent chapters. But if he had found any differences, he would not haue ſpared to ſet them down. In the chapters mentioned, he ſheweth not that we differ in any article of faith, or ſubſtantiall point of religion, but rather in rites, ceremonies, and ſome diuers interpretations of ſome words of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he would make his reader beléeue, <hi>that we haue no certaintie in religion,</hi> and that as he foole-wiſely imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>becauſe we haue no certaine rule whereby to direct our conſciences.</hi> And this he handleth both in his <hi>Wardword 1. <hi>Encontr.</hi>
                     </hi> and <hi>Warnw. 1. <hi>enc. c.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.</hi> and other places, ſkip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping like an ape vp an downe without rule, order or reaſon. But while he talketh of the rule of faith, he is direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himſelfe. For in his Wardw. p. <hi>6.</hi> he ſayth, <hi>that the vniuerſal Church was the direct rule and ſquire which we ought to follow,</hi> and in the <hi>Warnw. <hi>Enc.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>nu.</hi> 10.</hi> he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <hi>that it is the ſumme and corpes of Chriſtian doctrine deliuered at the beginning by the miracles and preachings of the Apoſtles.</hi> Where I omit to tell <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> that it is abſurd to make the ſame thing to be a rule and a ſquire, the rule being direct, and the ſquire being ſquare. It is alſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, though I do not tell him of it, to ſay <hi>that Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was deliuered by miracles:</hi> for it was deliuered by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and preaching, and confirmed by miracles. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbeare to tell him, that there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the Catholike Church and the Catholike doctrine. How then can theſe two make one rule? Next he taketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to my words, where I ſay that the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> hath a certaine rule to follow in matters of faith, as if
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18556:55"/> the canon of ſcriptures, and thoſe concluſions which are to be drawne out of them, were no certaine rule: or elſe as if traditions, that are no where certainly deſcribed or ſet downe, were a more certaine and authenticall rule then ſcriptures, and neceſſary deductions out of them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly he giueth out,<note place="margin">Warnw. 1. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cont. cap. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>that we deſpaire of all certaine rule or meane to trie the truth:</hi> which is a moſt deſperate and impudent kind of dealing. For directly I told him before, and now I tell him againe, that our rule is moſt certaine, being nothing elſe but the canonicall Scriptures, and the concluſions neceſſary drawne out of them. Nay this rule may in part be confirmed by <hi>Parſons</hi> his owne confeſſion. For if the corps of Chriſtian doctrine preached by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles be the rule of faith, as he ſaith <hi>VVarnw. 1. encont. c. 15.</hi> where are we to find it but in holy Scriptures? He holdeth percaſe that it is to be found in the Popes boſome. But if he ſay ſo in ſchooles, he ſhal not want a greater <hi>plaudit</hi> then he had, when hauing ended his comicall dealings in <hi>Bayliol</hi> colledge, he was rung and hiſſed out of the houſe. For who knoweth not, that ſcabs and villany are rather to be found in the Popes boſome, then any corpes of Apoſtolicall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? for that is very rife with them. With the corpes of Apoſtolicall doctrine the <hi>Italian</hi> atheiſticall Popes are litle acquainted.</p>
                  <p>We tel him further, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for trial of any point of doctrine we are not to run to the Popes ſea, which is as much able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue vs, as his cloſe ſtoole; but to the word of God reuealed in Scriptures, and if there be any difference about a place of Scriptures, we are then to compare the ſame with other places, to ſearch the reſolutions of Councels, of auncient and later Fathers, of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and learned men. Prouided alwayes that nothing be receiued as a ground of faith, which is not to be deduced out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God. Whether then <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> or <hi>Hierome,</hi> or <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> or <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Caluin,</hi> or any preacher among vs bring vs the word of God, it is to be receiued. But if they teach without that, we are not neceſſarily to credit them, nor to beléeue
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18556:56"/> them in grounds of faith.</p>
                  <p>Out of the Scriptures we learne, that <hi>Chriſt hath giuen ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Euangeliſts, ſome paſtors and teachers;</hi> albeit all particular matters are not preciſely ſet downe. So likewiſe we are taught that theſe words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> are moſt true, &amp; that the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is Chriſts body in a myſterie or ſacramentally, albeit how the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called Chriſts body there may be ſome differences. Likewiſe out of Scripture we are taught, that the King is the moſt principall man in his Realme, and not to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any other in externall gouernement, albeit euery one percaſe vnderſtandeth not the ſeuerall points of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority. Theſe differences therefore notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, our rule of faith is moſt certaine.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly he would inſinuate, that as vertue, houſkéeping, &amp; true dealing is much decayed, ſince her Maieſty came to the crowne, ſo pride in apparel, gluttony, drunkennes, lechery, ſwearing and other vices are much increaſed. But the man ſhould ſhew that theſe vertues are decayed, and vices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in men that are truly of our Religion. If he ſay ſo, then let him name the men that are guiltie of theſe faults. If the men that are guilty be Papiſts, that for the moſt part are knowne to be carnall and cruel, and moſt vitious, he ſtriketh himſelfe and not vs. If they be Atheiſts or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, then his allegation maketh not to purpoſe. This I will ſpeake to his téeth, that if our Miniſtery be no more honeſt and vertuous, then the Popes, Cardinals, Friers, and Maſſe-prieſts, and our true profeſſors then zelous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, it were pitie they ſhould liue on the face of the earth. Some proofes I haue brought before, and more I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage herafter. Let <hi>Parſons</hi> do the like againſt vs, and leaue his hypocriticall oſtentation, and generall declamation, that maketh men rather to wonder at his impudency, then to beléeue that he dealeth truly or ſincerely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Wardw. p. 3. Warnw. 1. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutr. cap. 18.</note>Sixthly, he very impudently imputeth all the troubles, wars and calamities that haue happened in <hi>Scotland, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Flanders</hi> &amp; <hi>France,</hi> to alteration in Religion, and wold
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18556:56"/> lay the blame wholy vpon vs. But if he looke into their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſes; he ſhall find, that the mint of this money was the Popes conſiſtorie, and that he and his agents are the onely firebrands of all miſchiefe. In <hi>Ireland, Gregorie</hi> the thirtéenth ſtirred vp rebellion by the traitor <hi>Saunders</hi> his legate: in <hi>England Pius Quintus</hi> by his agent <hi>Ridolphi</hi> and by <hi>Morton</hi> his meſſenger moued the two Earles to riſe in the North, <hi>Anno 1569.</hi> The ſame Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King to make warres againſt the Quéene of <hi>England,</hi> and againſt them of the Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The ſame Pope ſent not onely his agents, to ſtirre the <hi>French,</hi> but ayded them both with men and mony. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the thirtéenth likewiſe ſent ayde to <hi>Iriſh</hi> rebels. The wars of <hi>Germanie</hi> were enflamed by that butcherly Pope <hi>Paule the third.</hi> To make ſhort, all maſſacres, trecheries, warres and troubles haue wholy procéeded from their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt the truth. If the Pope and his adherents ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue bene troubled, ſo was <hi>Herode</hi> and all <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with him at the birth of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If they blame vs for their troubles, ſo did the <hi>Pagans</hi> impute all their troubles to Chriſtians, and their religion. But the true cauſe was not religion, but the hatred of impious Papiſts againſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>Finally, he ſaith, <hi>that if her Maieſtie had not altered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then her kingdome had bene flouriſhing and ſecure, and that ſhe would haue had iſſue, and her ſucceſſion certaine, and continued in friendſhip with the Pope, and auncient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and neither had wars abroad, nor treaſon at home:</hi> and inſinuateth, that by reaſon of alteration of religion al is fallen out contrarie. But if <hi>Wil Sommer</hi> had written this diſcourſe, he could neuer haue ſpoken more fooliſhly, nor impertinently. For firſt I haue ſhewed, that the ſtate of the kingdome for diuers reſpects was neuer more flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. Secondly, if any danger hanged ouer our heads, the ſame might eaſily be auoyded, if lawes had bene execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt traitors. Thirdly, it is now apparant to the world, that want of iſſue in her Maieſtie hath not hurt vs,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18556:57"/> God ſending vs ſo gracious and magnanimous a king. Fourthly his royall Maieſtie ſuccéeding in her throne hath declared, that ſhe wanted no ſucceſſion.

Fiftly, it is a ridiculous thing to tell vs of vnion with the Pope, and his mediation of peace. For there ought to be no agréement betweene Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Antichriſt. Here the Noddie will ſtorme, that his holy Father ſhould be called Antichriſt. But let him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer my reaſons in my fifth booke <hi>De Pont.

Sixtly, we haue ſo litle loſſe by breaking with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> king, that all men of knowledge pray, that either he may chaunge his former courſes, or that the warres may ſtill continue. Finally, this land hath no reaſon, either to feare forraine warres, or domeſticall treaſons, vnleſſe we will vncouple the Popes hounds, that come hither to teare the kings Maieſtie and State in péeces: which I hope he and his Councell of ſtate will looke vnto.</p>
                  <p>Whether then we looke into the Church, or the State; we muſt needes ſay, that Quéene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne was moſt happie. And that ſo much the rather, for that all her aduerſaries wit and malice doth not affoord any one ſound argument, that doth any way ſound to her diſgrace. <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> hath long barked in vaine againſt her procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.

               <p>So likewiſe ſome there are among vs, that not knowing, or not remembring the grieuances of the popiſh gouernment, nor wel conſidering their preſent freedome, and happie ſtate, looke backe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes golden promiſes, and rather will venture their ſoules and bodies, then ſtill enioy that libertie and freedome, which they haue receiued from their aunceſtors. Of this ſort are firſt a ſort of rinegued <hi>Engliſh</hi> fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, that runne to the Pope and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and are by them perſwaded to become ſacrificing Prieſts and traitors, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly ſuch, as are ſeduced by them, all of them drinking of the golden cuppe of the whoore of Babylon, and as if they had drunke of <hi>Circes</hi> cuppe, from men being transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beaſts, and brutiſh Papiſtes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to reclaime theſe haggard <hi>Engliſh</hi> if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to ſtay the ſtirring humours of others,, as I haue in the former Treatiſe recounted diuers excellent graces beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon our countrie and nation, by meanes of the pious and proſperous gouernment of our late Queene, that broke down the altars of <hi>Baal,</hi> and eſtabliſhed <hi>Chriſts</hi> true religion among vs; ſo now in the Diſcourſe enſuing I purpoſe by Gods grace to enter into a due conſideration of the calamities and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherto our natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſubiect during the raign of Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> and whereto all Papiſts liuing vnder the Popes iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction are ordinarily ſubiect. Wherein that I may proceede more perſpicuouſly, firſt I will ſpeak of matters of the Church, and then of matters of ciuill pollicie: and that firſt as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the King, and next as they concerne his people.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> according to his beſt skill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth to aduance popiſh gouernment, I haue thought it not amiſſe now and then, as the courſe of my Diſcourſe cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, to enterlace his idle arguments, and to refute them.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18556:58"/> Not that I ſuppoſe any man of reaſon will giue credit to ſuch a lying companion, that ſhutting his eyes againſt light, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth his tongue to walke and talke againſt all truth, but that by his trifling obiections you may perceiue our plaine dealing, and his paraſiticall and palpable gloſing. I may well ſay of this wicked Atheiſts wranglings, as <hi>Origen</hi> ſayd of <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> in his diſcourſe againſt Chriſtian Religion:<note place="margin">Lib. 1. contra Celſum.</note>

There is no danger, leaſt any faithfull man be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by them. God forbid that any ſhould be ſo cold in the loue of God, which is through Chriſt Ieſus, that be ſhould be diſturned from his godly purpoſe by Parſons</hi> his wrangling Wardwords and Warne-words, or by ſuch friuolous deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of any of his conſorts. But as the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>All haue not faith.</hi> And many want both the loue of God, and the loue they ought to beare to their Prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Againſt theſe I diſpute, and for thoſe I labour that perſiſt in their firſt loue. Marke therefore, I pray you, the ignorance of Papiſts in matters of Religion, the falſhood and abſurdities of their doctrine, the burthenſome and grieuous tyrannie of the Pope; and then iudge without partialitie, whether the ſame be not like the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and darkneſſe of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> out of which all true Chriſtians ought to deſire to be deliuered. God graunt all men grace to ſee it, and auoyde it.</p>

                  <p>Furthermore, the Prieſts in <hi>England</hi> were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to teach the people the worſhip of the croſſe, of images,

But not being able well to returne on foote, he prayed he might buy his horſe of the Saint. The prieſt was the broker and made the bargaine, but it was ſo hard, that the poore man ſaid, he was a good kéeper of ſheepe, but a cut-throate Saint to deale withall in buying and ſelling.</p>
                  <p>Commonly they neither vnderſtood what they prayed, nor what was ſaid in the Church, neither do they now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand much more, albeit the Prieſts in their new and falſe Catechiſmes endeuour to teach them ſomewhat.</p>

If they liue in darkneſſe, and without light, that want the light of Gods word; then is the darkneſſe of poperie great, where publike prayers, and Scriptures read publikely are kept vnder the couer of ſtrange tongues, as a candle vnder a buſhell.

Finally, if the people periſh, where there is no prophecying, as we reade <hi>Prouerb. 29.</hi> then are the Papiſts in a moſt fearefull and damnable ſtate, among whom the word of God is not ſincerely preached, and to whom wicked Maſſe-prieſts and Friars for the word of God preach humane deuiſes and lyes. The very heathen vnderſtood, <hi>that the knowledge of God was the beginning, the cauſe, and rule of humane happineſſe.</hi>

                  <p>Againſt this aſſertion, I doubt not but <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> will take exception, who in his <hi>Wardw. pag. 12.</hi> ſtormeth, when he heareth vs but once to mention the ignorance of Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> times. But the matter is too manifeſt for him to face out with bigge words. He telleth vs of <hi>Tonſtal, Watſon, Chriſtophorſon, Feckham, Gardiner</hi> and <hi>White.</hi> But neither was the learning of theſe men extraordinarie, as ſome of their doings yet extant declare, nor was their learning great in the true knowledge of diuinity. Nor was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18556:66"/> this a good conſequence, theſe men were learned, therfore the people were alſo learned. For theſe men ſeldome prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and but to few, and to very litle edification. He addeth therefore in the <hi>Warn-word 2. Encountr. cap. 6. that the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and skill of Doctors and teachers maketh the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and skilfull.</hi> But that is, where they teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the people, which theſe did not. There alſo he telleth vs, <hi>that in other countries the common people, yea children and babes are able to anſwer in Chriſtian religion.</hi> But firſt this concerneth times paſt nothing. And next this faſhion of catechizing is but in few places exerciſed, and by the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſites</hi> in imitation of true teachers. For ſo the diuels mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters imitate <hi>Chriſts</hi> Apoſtles. Thirdly, the Catechiſme of Papiſts is nothing, but the <hi>Creede,</hi> the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>ſeuen Sacraments,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deuideth his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in his Italian Catechiſme: and of <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deuiſes, as other Catechiſmes ſhew. Fourthly, there is much mixture of ceremonies and falſe doctrine. Finally, the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> are litle wiſer for this cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing.</p>
                  <p>He telleth vs alſo in his <hi>Wardw. p. 12.</hi> of the profound learning of the ſchool-doctors in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> and ſaith, We dare not once appeare to diſpute with them. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maketh the ſkill of the diuers ſects of Friars for the Prieſts or the people, that are not taught by them. Nor is their learning ſkill in Scriptures or Fathers, which few of them reade, as appeareth by the confeſſion of <hi>Ferdinand Velloſillo</hi> in his preface vpon his <hi>aduertences</hi> on the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. Nor are there ſo many learned, as is pretended. True it is, that they are now more diligent, then they were in time paſt, but it is rather to ſuppreſſe truth, then to teach truth. For they teach ſeldome, and talke of vaine ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and deſire nothing, but that the people ſhould be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in Gods word: which popiſh ignorance is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> as in time paſt.

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the common workes of Papiſts.</head>
                  <p>BVt may our aduerſaries ſay, albeit in time paſt men were not ſo learned; yet they liued better then men of our times. And true it is that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Li. 3. conf. c. 8</note> 
                     <hi>That men vnlearned earneſtly contend for heauen, while learned men without vnderſtanding wallow in fleſh and blood:</hi> if we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of thoſe that onely had learned <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> and him crucified, and were vnſkilfull in other matters; and not of thoſe rude and ignorant people, that albeit cunning in worldly affaires, were notwithſtanding vtterly ignorant of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Wherefore as we haue before proued the Papiſts to be commonly moſt ignorant of diuine matters, ſo now we will briefly touch their liues and actions, to ſee if their manners correſpond with their ſkill. And the rather I follow this courſe,<note place="margin">De indulgen.</note> for that <hi>Schoppius</hi> telleth vs of their braue workes done in the times of <hi>Iubileys,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Parſons</hi> is euer talking of good workes, as if that were the proper poſſeſſion of his conſorts. Wherein I would not haue any to thinke that when I name Papiſts, I meane to ſpeake againſt all our forefathers (who indeed poſitiuely held not all points of popery, but rather profeſſed Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie poſitiuely, albeit they did not reſolutely denie popiſh errors) but onely ſuch as are the chiefe founders, teachers, and maintainers of popiſh Religion, and which with great zeale perſecute all that reſiſt it, or refuſe it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe fellowes therefore, I ſay, haue no cauſe to glorie or boaſt of their workes. For whether we looke into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of times of ſtates of men, or elſe conſider euery ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and good worke by it ſelfe, or looke into the countries drowned in Popery; I doubt not but we ſhall find the zela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and chiefe pillers of popery very defectiue, and no way anſwerable to the commendation which their hired Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do commonly giue them.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the erronious, and abſurd doctrine of Papiſts, concerning the foundations of Chriſtian Religion.</head>
                  <p>WRetched is the ſtate of thoſe, that liue in darkneſſe and ignorance, and without the knowledge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and vertue. <hi>Ignorantia magnum malum,</hi> and as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, <hi>neſcire turpe: <hi>It is a ſhame not to know.</hi>
                     </hi> But not to know God, nor his lawes, is both ſhamefull and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Qui ignorat, ignorabitur,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: that is,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>God will not know him, that is ignorant of God.</hi> Yet farre worſe it is, to do maliciouſly and wickedly, then onely to liue in ignorance and blindneſſe. But worſt of all it is, to hold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately dangerous and falſe opinions, contrarie to the faith of Chriſt. If then beſide their ignorance and leudnes, the Papiſts hold diuers erronious and falſe opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning religion, then cannot their eſtate be otherwiſe, then miſerable. Let vs therefore ſée, what they hold both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the foundations, and alſo concerning diuers neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie points of religion.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts giue out, <hi>that the Pope is the foundation, and the rocke, vpon which the Church is built. Bellarmine lib. 2. de pontif. Rom. cap. 31.</hi> talking of the Popes titles ſaith,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18556:73"/> that he is called a <hi>foundation,</hi> and that he is <hi>fundamentum aedificij Eccleſiae, <hi>the foundation of the building of the Church.</hi>
                     </hi> In his Preface before his bookes <hi>de Pontif. Rom.</hi> ſpeaking of theſe words of <hi>Iſay, <hi>Ecce ponam in fundamentis Sion lapidem, lapidem probatum, angularem;</hi>
                     </hi> ſaith, <hi>that theſe words not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly may be applyed to the Pope:</hi> as if he were that corner ſtone, that is placed in the foundations of <hi>Sion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stapleton</hi> likewiſe in his Preface before the relection of his doctrinall principles, affirmeth deſperately, <hi>that God ſpeaketh in the Pope, and that the foundation of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is neceſſarily placed in his authoritie teaching vs.</hi> It was much to ſay, that he was any way the foundation of religion. But to make him <hi>a neceſſarie foundation,</hi> was a greater preſumption, then I find in his fellows. His words are theſe, <hi>In hac docentis hominis authoritate, in qua Deum lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentem audimus, religionis noſtrae cognoſcendae fundamentum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſariò poni cernimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither can any of them well deny, but that the Pope is the rocke, vpon which the Church is built, and againſt which the gates of hell cannot preuaile, ſéeing generally they proue the Popes authoritie out of <hi>Chriſts</hi> words to <hi>Peter, Mat. 16.</hi> For if theſe words be not meant of the Pope, but of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed; then are they fondly alleaged for iuſtification of the Popes authoritie.</p>
                  <p>In ſumme all their practiſe ſheweth, that the Pope to them is <hi>ſumma ſummarum,</hi> and the corner ſtone, and chiefe foundation of the popiſh Church. For alleage Scriptures, they quarrell about the interpretation, and admit no ſence but that which the Pope alloweth, although his gloſſes and interpretations be neuer ſo contrarie to the text. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, alleage Councels, they enquire, if the Pope haue allowed them. Alleage Fathers ſpeaking againſt the Pope, they reiect them. But alleage the Popes determination, there they ſtop like reſtie iades, and will not be drawne further. So the Pope and his reſolutions are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nay, they are all in all with Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>But this is not onely contrarie to the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18556:73"/> 
                     <hi>Iſay 8.</hi> and <hi>28. Mat. 16.</hi> and <hi>1. Cor. 3.</hi> and <hi>Epheſ. 2.</hi> where Chriſt is made the corner ſtone and ſole foundation of the Church, but alſo contrarie to all Fathers, and good interpreters of Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is alſo moſt abſurd and contrarie to reaſon. For firſt if the Pope were the foundation of the Church; then ſhould there be as many foundations, as Popes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Church ſhould be built vpon foundations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers from Chriſt. Thirdly, the foundations of the Church ſhould differ one from another, one Pope contradicting, and croſſing another. Fourthly, the Popes being ſometimes reprobates and damned, hell ſhould preuaile againſt the foundation of the Church, which is moſt abſurd. Fiftly, the Church during the vacation ſhould be without foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and a woman being Pope, the Church ſhould be built vpon a woman. Finally, the Church ſhould be built vpon men ſubiect to infirmities, errors and mutations, and not vpon Chriſt Ieſus, the vnmoueable rocke.</p>

Afterward in his <hi>Analyſis</hi> prefixed before his <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall principles,</hi> deliuering to his diſciples the grounds of Chriſtian religion, he vouchſafeth the ſcriptures no place among them.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, if by the books of the old teſtament they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all the bookes contained in the old latine vulgar tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Bible; then they admit the third and fourth bookes of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and all additions to the originall text, to be canoniall ſcriptures: which contradicteth their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crées concerning the canon of Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly it is abſurd to make vnwritten traditions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with the holy Scriptures. For theſe are certainly knowne to procéed from God. But of vnwritten traditions the aduerſaries can bring no proofe, but from men. Now who is ſo preſumptuous as to match the teſtimonies of men with the word of God? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his <hi>48.</hi> epiſtle to <hi>Vincentius,</hi> ſpeaking of the fathers writings, ſaith, <hi>they are to be diſtinguiſhed from the authoritie of the canon.</hi> And in his eight epiſtle which is to <hi>Hierome,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that vnto the Scriptures alone this prerogatiue is to be giuen, that none of them containeth any errors.</hi> All other authors he wold haue cenſured and examined by them, being not free from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
                  <p>The holy Scriptures are alwayes conſonant and agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to themſelues. But traditions do not onely contradict one another, but alſo are repugnant to holy Scriptures.

                  <p>The fourth foundation of Romiſh religion is the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Pope in matters of faith.<note place="margin">Seſſ. 4.</note> The Conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Trent</hi> teacheth, <hi>that it belongeth to the holy mother the Church to iudge of the true meaning of Scriptures.</hi> Now for as much as no man knoweth more certainely, what is the holy mother Churches meaning, then the Papiſts holy Father the Pope, therefore they do hereof conclude, that the Pope is to determine principally of the true ſence and meaning of Scriptures.</p>

Our Sauiour in the inſtitution of the holy Euchariſt, ſaid, <hi>Take, eate:</hi> but they beléeue the Pope, that ſaith, Gape and gaze, but take not, nor eate: but rather hang vp the Sacrament. He ſaid, <hi>Bibite ex hoc omnes,</hi> that is, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> but the Pope ſaith, Drinke not all of this, and they beleeue the Pope. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is better to marrie then to burne,</hi> and <hi>that mariage is honorable among all men.</hi> But the Pope doth interpret theſe words ſo, as if he had ſaid: It is better to burne then to marrie, and that mariage is reprochfull and vnlawfull to Prieſts: and Papiſts beléeue the Pope. So do they likewiſe in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit falſe interpretations.</p>
                  <p>But that the Popes interpretations and ſentences ſhold be the foundation of religion, is a matter contrarie to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and reaſon.

                     </hi> ſaith he. And afterward he declareth, that thoſe, whom the Pope ſendeth, are ſent by Chriſt, and the men which he meaneth.

                  <p>TRue Religion is moſt true, venerable, and reſpectiue of Gods true ſeruice. If then popiſh Religion containe any vntrue or ridiculous, vaine, and blaſphemous doctrine, then is it not true, or Apoſtolicall, or Chriſtian: nor can it ſtand with Chriſtian Religion, ſéeing no man can ſerue God and <hi>Baal,</hi> nor <hi>Dagon</hi> could ſtand before the arke of God. But notorious it is, that popiſh Religion containeth many blaſphemous, ridiculous, and abſurd points.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, concerning the fleſh of our Lord and Sauior Chriſt Ieſus they teach falſly and blaſphemouſly, and ſay, <hi>that a mouſe or dog, or hog may eate the body of Chriſt.</hi> Nay they are not aſhamed to affirme, <hi>that his moſt holy body may be caſt out vpon a dunghill, or into any vncleane place. <hi>Prima opinio</hi>
                     </hi> (ſaith <hi>Alexander Hales <hi>part.</hi> 4. <hi>ſum. q.</hi> 53. <hi>m.</hi> 2.) <hi>quae dicit quod corpus Chriſti defertur, quocunque ſpecies deferunt, vt in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem canis, vel ſuis, vel in alia lo ca immunda, videtur vera.</hi>

                     </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſee no reaſon why the body of Chriſt ſhould not withall paſſe into the belly of a dog or hog. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> likewiſe, although made a ſaint by the Pope, yet ſhameth not to hold this prophane and vnholy opinion, <hi>part. <hi>3.</hi> q. <hi>80.</hi> art. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </hi> And in his comment. <hi>in <hi>4.</hi> ſent. diſt. <hi>9.</hi> q. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </hi> The ſame is alſo ſtiffely maintained by <hi>Brulifer <hi>in</hi> 4. <hi>ſent. diſt.</hi> 13. <hi>queſt.</hi> 5.</hi> And this is the common opinion of ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>That the prieſt is able to make his Creator, they make no queſtion. <hi>Bonner</hi> counted this among the prerogatiues of prieſthood, in his abſurd ſpéech which he made in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18556:79"/> houſe in the beginning of Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> reigne. And <hi>Innocentius</hi> in the myſteries of the Maſſe, <hi>lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>19.</hi>
                     </hi> holdeth the ſame very confidently. <hi>Panis in Chriſtum tranſubſtantiatur</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>&amp; ita in creatorem. Sic ergo creatura quotidie fit creator. <hi>Bread is tranſubſtantiate into Chriſt, and ſo into the creator: and therfore a creature euery day is a creator.</hi>
                     </hi> The like ſayings are to be found in the booke called <hi>Stella clericorum,</hi> and diuers other authors. Neither do theſe men doubt, but that the communicants do eate their Maker. But this is moſt abſurd, and offenſiue to the <hi>Turkes</hi> and heathen, that Chriſtians ſhould be ſayd to eate vp their God, and for this cauſe <hi>Auerroes</hi> ſaid, that of all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, that of the Papiſts was moſt ridiculous. It is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd alſo to ſay, that man can make God, or the creature his Creator.</p>
                  <p>They affirme alſo that Chriſt at his laſt ſupper did truly and really eate vp his owne body whole and entire. As if Chriſt had come into the world not onely to be eaten car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of others, but alſo to deuoure and eate vp himſelfe: a matter moſt abſurd, and clearely repugnant to ſcriptures, fathers, and ſenſe. For Scriptures and Fathers teach, that Chriſt took bread, and called it his body. And ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teacheth vs, that it is vnnatural for one man to eate vp another, and impoſſible for the ſame man to eate vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For then there ſhould be no difference betwixt the termes of relation: and the ſame man ſhould be the eater, and the thing eaten; the thing containing, and contained; and the ſame perſon ſhould be a relatiue to himſelfe: which is againſt all rules of Logicke, ſenſe, and common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>While they ſay, that Chriſtians do really and carnally eate Chriſts fleſh, and drink his blood, they make them Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals, and wsrſe then the barbarous Scythians and Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matians, that drunke their horſes blood. For it is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane to drinke mans blood then horſes blood, and Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals are nothing elſe but barbarous eaters of mans fleſh. Neither can they defend themſelues by the words of our
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18556:79"/> Sauior, <hi>Iohn 6.</hi> who ſayth, <hi>vnleſſe we eate his fleſh and drink his bloud, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue life in vs.</hi> For he addeth, <hi>that the ſpirit quickneth, and the fleſh profiteth nothing:</hi> condemning the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> that imagined that his fleſh was to be torne with téeth, and his blood ſwallowed downe into the belly carnally as the Papiſts alſo imagine: and reprouing all carnall and literall interpretations of his words. <hi>Haec inquam, omnia carnalia myſticè &amp; ſpiritualiter intelligenda ſunt. <hi>All theſe carnall things</hi>
                     </hi> (ſayth <hi>Chryſoſtome <hi>hom.</hi> 46. <hi>in Ioan.</hi>) are to be vnderſtood myſtically and ſpiritually.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> in <hi>Leuit. 7.</hi> ſayth, <hi>that the literall vnderſtanding of theſe words, Vnleſſe ye eate the fleſh of the ſon of man, &amp;c. killeth. Auguſtine</hi> alſo teacheth, that theſe words are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſacramentally, and <hi>that being ſpiritually vnderſtood they quicken.</hi> But what ſhould I ſpeake of the Fathers of the Church, ſéeing <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> talking of <hi>Polyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> do condemne the eating of mans fleſh, as a thing both barbarous and monſtrous?</p>
                  <p>Concerning Chriſt his incarnation they teach ſtrangely,<note place="margin">Catech. Rom. in Symbol.</note> ſaying, that he being borne of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe paſſe out of the womb, <hi>then as the Sun beames do paſſe through the ſubſtance of the glaſſe:</hi> their words are, <hi>Vt ſolis radij concretam vitri ſubſtantiam penetrant:</hi> which do plainely ouerthrow the myſtery of his natiuity. For how was he true man, if neuer man paſſed through his mothers womb, as the ſun paſſeth through glaſſe? or how was he like to vs in all things, ſinne onely except, if he were not borne like to vs?</p>
                  <p>They beleeue alſo and teach, that Chriſt his body did paſſe through the graue ſtone, when he roſe from death, and through the doore when he entred the houſe where his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were aſſembled, after his reſurrection. <hi>The Fathers hold</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine <hi>lib.</hi> 3, <hi>de Euchariſt. cap.</hi> 16.) that Chriſts true body came out of the ſepulcher being ſhut: <hi>Quod per clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum ſepulchrum verum corpus exiuerit.</hi>
                     </hi> And his meaning is, that his true body paſſed through the ſtone at the graues mouth, as may wel be gathered by the drift of his diſcourſe,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18556:80"/> where he refuteth the opinion of thoſe that held that the graue ſtone yeelded and gaue place to Chriſts body. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the ſame place ſpeaking of Chriſts comming to his Diſciples <hi>the doores being ſhut,</hi> he affirmeth <hi>that Chriſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſolide body through another ſolide body: <hi>Quod Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus corpus ſuum ſolidum per aliud ſolidum introduxerit.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſacrament they ſay that Chriſt his true body is really: and by conſequent confeſſe, that the ſame is in as many diuers places at once, as is the ſacrament. They hold alſo, that the ſame body is there neither felt nor ſeene, and that he is not extended according to the nature of an humane body, nor occupieth any place being in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But theſe are matters direct contrary to the doctrine of the Apoſtles and fathers: they alſo repugne againſt reaſon, and imply notorious contradictions. <hi>They brought him to Ieruſalem</hi> (ſayth <hi>Luke c. 2.) to preſent him to the Lord, as it is written in the law; euery male child that firſt openeth the wombe, ſhall be called holy to the Lord. <hi>Matris vulua</hi>
                     </hi> (ſayth <hi>Origen <hi>hom.</hi> 14. <hi>in Luc.) eo tempore reſerata eſt, quo &amp; partus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus.</hi> The mothers wombe was then opened, when her child was brought forth. Tertullian <hi>lib. de reſurr. carnis:</hi>
                     </hi> ſpeaking likewiſe of Chriſts birth: <hi>Who</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>was truly holy, but the ſonne of God? Who did properly open the wombe, but he which opened it being ſhut?</hi> The ſame ſayth <hi>Ambroſe, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>in Luc. c.</hi> 7.</hi> Neither is this any blemiſh to the bleſſed virgins perpetuall virginitie. For that is not loſt nor periſhed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerture of the matrix, which may diuerſly happen; but by the carnall knowledge of man.</p>
                  <p>Further we reade <hi>Heb. 2.</hi> that <hi>Chriſt tooke mans nature, and not of Angels; and that it behoued him in all things to be like to his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> In <hi>Luke</hi> the foure and twentith chapter, when our Sauior Chriſt would proue himſelfe to be man, &amp; not a ſpirit, he ſayd, <hi>Palpate &amp; videte, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Feele and ſee: a ſpirit hath neither fleſh nor bones, as you ſee me to haue.</hi> We do alſo profeſſe in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, that as he is perfect God, ſo he is perfect man. <hi>Ignatius <hi>Epiſt. ad Polycarp.</hi>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:18556:80"/> Ambroſe <hi>in Luc.</hi> 24. Theodoret dial. 2.</hi> and diuers other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers acknowledge, that Chriſt his body is to be felt and ſeene, and that he hath fleſh, blood and bones like vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>But if our Sauiour Chriſt did no otherwiſe paſſe out of his mothers wombe, then as light through glaſſe, then was he no perfect man, nor fleſhly ſubſtance. The ſame may alſo be concluded, if his body did paſſe through ſtones or boords of doores. For neuer did any man paſſe through ſtones or boordes in that ſort, nor did euer any man come out of his mother, as light from glaſſe. Further, this ſauoreth much of the hereſie of the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> that ſuppoſed that Chriſt had no naturall fleſh, nor true body, and deſtroyeth the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Chriſts incarnation and natiuitie. If he haue a body that can neither be felt nor ſeene, then hath he no true body. Which alſo followeth, if his body may be in infinite places at once, and yet fill no place. For neuer yet had any man ſuch a body, that could be in many places at once, and yet fil no place.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, nothing could more repugne againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then that a mans body ſhould paſſe through ſtones and boords, or be as ſubtile as the beames of the ſunne, or that a man ſhould ſubſiſt without the natural properties of mans nature, as weight, height, depth, bredth, colour, groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſuch like. And as well may a body be in all places, as in euery altar. For a body cannot be in two extreame termes, but the ſame muſt be in the midſt. Furthermore, if all the world may be turned into bread, and bread into Chriſts body, then may Chriſts body fill the whole world, as <hi>Bellarmine <hi>lib. de incarnat. c.</hi> 11.</hi> confeſſeth. He doeth alſo confeſſe,<note place="margin">De Incar. c. 12</note> 
                     <hi>that the vbiquity of Chriſts body is repugnant to the articles of our Creede concerning Chriſts conception, natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, death, buriall, deſcenſion to hell, aſcenſion to heauen, and comming to iudgement.</hi> If then he be not able to defend the vbiquitie of Chriſts bodie in euery conſerated hoaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out yéelding ſimply to the vbiquitaries, then it followeth that the reall preſence of Chriſtes body, as it is taught by the Papiſtes, doeth ouerthrow diuers articles of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18556:81"/> ſaith by the very confeſſion of the aduerſaries. The ſame alſo may otherwiſe be proued, if they ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſo much. For how is Chriſt aſcended, if his body be hanging ouer euery altar? How is it credible that he ſhall come from heauen to iudge quicke and dead, if he be lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in euery conſecrate hoaſt? How was he conceiued, and borne of the virgine, and ſuffered death on the croſſe, if he had a body of ſuch a ſimple nature, that it was like light in glaſſe, and might be in many places at once without filling any?</p>
                  <p>Finally it implyeth a notorious contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Chriſts body to be in heauen viſible, and here inuiſible; to be there palpable, and here impalpable; to be continued, and not continued; eaten here, and not eaten in heauen; here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out filling of a place, there filling a place; here in the prieſts hands, and there not.</p>
                  <p>Abſurdly alſo do the Papiſts talke of Chriſt his moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle <hi>Heb. c. 9.) was once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that he might take away the ſinnes of many.</hi> And <hi>Hebr. 10. Chriſt hauing offered one ſacrifice for ſinnes, doth perpetually ſit at the right hand of God.</hi> And againe: <hi>With one oblation he hath for euer ſanctified thoſe that are ſanctified.</hi> But the Papiſts ſay, that our Sauior offered him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe twiſe, once at his laſt ſupper, and the ſecond time vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe.<note place="margin">Synod. Trid. ſeſſ. 22. c. 1.</note> They teach alſo, that the prieſt in euery Maſſe doth offer vp the body and blood of Chriſt really for a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for quicke and dead. The which is not only contrary to Scriptures, but derogateth much from the perfection and vnitie of Chriſts ſacrifice. For how is Chriſts ſacrifice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if the ſame be ſo often reiterated? How is Chriſt his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice one and the ſame, if euery pelting prieſt do offer vp this ſacrifice? The ſame is contrary to the doctrine of the Fathers, which teach that the ſacrifices of Chriſtians are ſpiritual, and no where ſay, that they offer vp Chriſts body and bloud really. <hi>Iuſtin <hi>in dial. cum Tryph.</hi>
                     </hi> ſaith, <hi>that prayers and praiſes of God are the onely acceptable ſacrifices of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> With him concurreth <hi>Tertullian <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>contra Marcione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:18556:81"/> This viſible ſacrifice</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>de ciuit. Dei ca.</hi> 5.</hi> ſpeaking of the Euchariſt) <hi>is a ſacrament of the inuiſible ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> that is, <hi>the ſame is a holy ſigne of it.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome <hi>hom.</hi> 17. <hi>in epiſt. ad Heb.</hi>
                     </hi> ſaith, <hi>that our oblation is but a commemoration of Chriſt his death,</hi> and <hi>a figure of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which Chriſt made.</hi> Finally, it is moſt blaſphemous. For in the Maſſe the prieſt taketh on him to be a mediator for Chriſt, and prayeth <hi>that God would looke on Chriſt with a propitious and ſerene countenance, &amp; accept the ſacrifice of his body as he vouchſafed to accept the offerings of Abel, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and Melchiſedech.</hi> The ſcriptures teach vs, that Chriſt onely is a prieſt <hi>after the order of Melchiſedech,</hi> as we may reade in the <hi>110.</hi> pſalme, in the fift and ſeuenth chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes. The Lord hath ſworne and it ſhall not repent him,</hi> ſaith God by his Prophet, <hi>thou art a prieſt for euer after the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> The ſame alſo is proued, for that he onely continueth for euer. He was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out father concerning his humane nature, without mother concerning his diuine nature, and hath neither beginning nor ending. But the Maſſe-prieſts continue not for euer, nor are they without father or mother, nor are they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning or ending. Are they not theri preſumptuous fellowes to enter vpon Chriſts office, and to arrogate to themſelues prieſthood after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But were they prieſts after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> yet did <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> neuer offer the body and blood of any man, nor do we reade that either he or Chriſt did offer for the quicke and dead at his laſt ſupper. Are they not then fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious fellowes, that imagine themſelues able to offer the ſon of God? Are they not preſumptuous prieſts, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant haue deuiſed ſuch a ſacrifice? Our Sauiour Chriſt ſayth, <hi>that ſuch do worſhip God in vaine, which teach doctrines, which are the commaundements of men.</hi> But theſe fellowes deuiſe a worſhip of God contrary to his word crucifying Chriſt againe, and laying violent hands vpon him according to their owne imaginations.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt hath taught vs to pray vnto the Father in his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18556:82"/> name, ſaying, <hi>Our father which art in heauen.</hi> He hath alſo promiſed we ſhall obtaine our prayers which we ſhall ſo make. <hi>If you ſhall aske my father any thing in my name</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>he will giue it vnto you.</hi> The Apoſtle doth alſo teach vs, that as there is but one God, ſo there is but one Mediator betwixt God &amp; man, the man <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> In the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes we reade,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>that it behoued vs to haue an high Prieſt, holy, innocent, vndefiled, ſeparated from ſinners, and higher then the heauens.</hi> For ſuch a one onely was able to reconcile vs, and to make interceſſion for vs. As for Angels, Saints, or ſaints relikes, the auncient fathers did neuer vſe as mediators, or interceſſors, or ſpokeſmen to God. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> in his treatiſe of <hi>Iſac</hi> ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt is our mouth, by which we ſpeake to the Father; and our eye, by which we ſee the Father; and our right hand, by which we offer to our Father. S. Auguſtine</hi> writing vpon the <hi>108.</hi> Pſalme, affirmeth, that the prayer which is not offered by Chriſt, is not onely not able to put away ſinne, but alſo is ſinne it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But the blind Papiſts teach vs a farre different forme of prayer, and flie to the mediation of our Ladie, of Saints, of Angels, of the croſſe; as if theſe were our interceſſors and mediators, and as if the prieſthood of Chriſt had bene tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to ſaints.

In the Roſary ſhe is called, <hi>the repairer and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior of a deſperate ſoule, the diſtiller and giuer of ſpirituall grace. Goodric</hi> a certaine holy hermit, that liued in <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſecond king of <hi>England</hi> his dayes, prayed thus: <hi>O holy Mary, Chriſts mariage chamber, virginall puritie, flower of thy mother, put away my ſinnes, raigne in me, leade me vnto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe with God.</hi> In the feaſt of <hi>S.

                     </hi> And on <hi>S. Nicholas</hi> day they pray thus: <hi>O God which haſt adorned Nicholas thy Biſhop with innumerable miracles, grant we beſeech thee that through his merits and prayers we may be deliuered from the flames of hell.</hi> But if prayers be fruitleſſe, if not ſinfull, if they procéed not from true faith, and if faith be grounded vpon vndoubted and prime truth, how can theſe prayers auaile vs, that are grounded vpon <hi>S. Catherines</hi> and <hi>S. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> his legends? Againe, if Chriſt be the mediator of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation onely, as the Papiſts hold, how can they hope to be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18556:83"/> ſaued by the merites of <hi>S. Catherine</hi> and <hi>S. Nicholas?</hi> And how can they deny them to be mediators of ſaluation, by whoſe merits they ſuppoſe to be ſaued? I will not aſk them what <hi>Catherine</hi> and <hi>Nicholas</hi> haue to do with them, but yet they may do wel to proue that there was euer any ſuch vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the world, being the daughter of king <hi>Coſtus,</hi> as they giue out.</p>
                  <p>Vpon <hi>S. Francis</hi> his day they vſe this prayer: <hi>O God which by the merites of bleſſed S. Francis doeſt amplifie thy Church with the birth of new children, graunt that by his imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation we may deſpiſe earthly things, and alwayes reioyce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made partakers of heauenly gifts through Chriſt our Lord.</hi> But the Apoſtle exhorteth vs to be followers of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and of others ſo far as they be followers of Chriſt: and iuſtly we may doubt, whether <hi>Francis</hi> followed Chriſt or no, being the author of a rule diuers from that of Chriſt, and of diuers ſtrange fancies. We may alſo well make a queſtion, whether his diſciples be Chriſts true diſciples, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctors of <hi>Paris</hi> affirmed, <hi>they were in the ſtate of damnation.</hi> Sure we are, that by Chriſts merits, and not by his merits or imitation, we are made partakers of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifts.</p>
                  <p>Vpon <hi>S. Bathildis</hi> day, according to the order of <hi>Satum</hi> Miſſal they prayed, <hi>that her merites might obtaine, that their ſacrifices &amp; oblations might be accepted ſeeing ſhe offered vp her ſelf a liuing, holy, and welpleaſing ſacrifice vnto God:</hi> as if Chriſts body and bloud were not to be accepted, but by the merits of <hi>S. Bathildis,</hi> or as if by her ſacrifice, our ſins were done away.</p>
                  <p>Vpon <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his day they prayed, <hi>that by the blood of Thomas they might aſcend to heauen.</hi> And on <hi>S. Lucies</hi> day they pray, <hi>O Lucie, ſpouſe of Chriſt, thou didſt hate the things of the world, and ſhineſt with Angels, by thine owne blood thou haſt ouercome thine enemie.</hi> As if men were ſaued by the blood of <hi>Thomas,</hi> as wel as Chriſts blood: and as if Saints by their owne blood, without Chriſt, could ouercome their enemies.</p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:18556:83"/>
                  <p>So wicked and blaſphemous theſe prayers are, that the moſt ingenious Doctors of the popiſh ſchoole haue much a do to excuſe them, and do very badly agrée either one with another, or with the truth. <hi>Hoſius <hi>in confeſſ. petrik. ca.</hi> 58.</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>When a man commeth to ſaints, he doth not deſire mercie of them, but onely their interceſſion.</hi> And again: <hi>We giue no more vnto them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when we call vpon them, triumphing with Chriſt in heauen, then to any one of our brethren militant on earth.</hi> But therein he lyeth notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. For commonly they call the virgine <hi>Mary mother of mercy,</hi> and deſire her to protect them, and to do away their ſinnes. Likewiſe they pray to be ſaued by the blood of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> &amp; by the merites of other ſaints: which I trow is more then they will giue to euery one of their brethren in earth.</p>

For if they did onely intercede for vs, then one ſaint might ſerue for al purpoſes, and then ſhould they onely appeare as ſuppliants to God, and not as beſtowers of graces and workers of wonders.

                  <p>Are not the Paiſts then in miſerable ſtate, that forgetting for the moſt part their onely Mediator and Redéemer, run to ſaints and Angels? nay, runne to ſuch as are no ſaints, nor euer were in the world, as <hi>George</hi> that killed the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, <hi>Catherin</hi> the daughter of <hi>Coſtus, Chriſtopher</hi> that bore Chriſt, and ſuch like?</p>

                     <hi>thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vs to thy Father:</hi> and calling a blocke <hi>mother of mercie,</hi> and ſaying before ſtockes and ſtones: <hi>Our Father,</hi> and <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> and knocking their breaſts, and whipping themſelues before Images, as the idolatrous Prieſts did before their idols. The Apoſtle when he laid before the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> the miſerable ſtate they ſtood in, while they were yet Gentils, he vſeth no other tearmes then theſe: <hi>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, and were caried away vnto dumbe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, as ye were led.</hi> Which is as much, as if he ſhould ſay: You were miſerable and blind, when ye were caried away vnto dumbe Idols. Why then may we not ſay the ſame to Papiſts? They may percaſe deny the caſe to be like. But in my challenge I haue by many arguments proued them to be groſſe Idolaters, &amp; haue clearely ſhewed, that they haue no better excuſe for their worſhip of Images, then the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Gentiles had for their worſhip of idoles. Are they not then likewiſe blind and miſerable? Thinking to thruſt others out of their ſocietie, which they call the Church, they haue flatly excluded themſelues from the ſocietie and communion of the Catholike Church. For if their Church be <hi>a companie of men profeſſing the ſame faith, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the ſame Sacraments, vnder the rule of lawfull paſtors, and eſpecially of the Pope: as Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib. 2. de Eccl. milit. cap. 2.</hi> then are they not the catholike Church. For that Church was long before either Pope or Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſide that, falſe it is, that either the Apoſtles, or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18556:85"/> whole Apoſtolike Church was ſubiect to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that <hi>Iohn the Euangeliſt,</hi> that liued long after <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> was ſubiect to <hi>Linus, Cletus,</hi> or <hi>Clement,</hi> in whoſe time he liued. Finally, falſe it is, that God appointed the church to be gouerned by the Biſhops of <hi>Rome:</hi> there is nothing thereof in Scriptures. The Fathers ſhew, that the chiefe authoritie in externall matters was in generall Councels and Emperors. And <hi>Bellarmines</hi> idle diſputes concerning his Pope are long ſince ouerthrowne.</p>
                  <p>That they are not the true Church, it appeareth alſo, for that they heare not the voice of Chriſt, but follow a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: for that they haue receiued diuers hereſies, and deuiſed new Sacraments, relinquiſhing <hi>Chriſt</hi> his inſtitution in the celebration of the Lords ſupper for that they haue other foundations of their religion, then were laid by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Apoſtles: for that they perſecute true Chriſtians, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them, and maſſacre them, and by all meanes perſecute them: and for diuers other reaſons laid downe in mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> booke <hi>De Eccleſ. militante.</hi> If then it be not poſſible to be ſaued without the Church, in what caſe are they, that running after the Pope, which is that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh <hi>2.

And whither are they runne? forſooth into the confuſion of <hi>Babylon:</hi> where the Pope, Cardinals, Maſſe prieſts,<note place="margin">De Eccleſ. milit. cap. 2.</note> &amp; Friars make merchandize of mens ſoules. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, <hi>that neither faith, hope, nor charitie, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internall vertue is required, that a man abſolutely may be ſaid to be a part of the Church, but onely an externall profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the faith and communion of the Sacraments.</hi> Who then will not leaue that ſocietie, which, for ought that we know, may be a packe of <hi>Turkes</hi> and infidels, without all vertue, religion, and honeſtie, eſpecially if they profeſſe the Romiſh faith externally?</p>
                  <p>Further, as they haue excluded themſelues from the Church, ſo they haue put themſelues vnder the ſubiection of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that is the head of the malignant Church, and to his Cardinals, Maſſe-prieſts, and Friars, which

In confirmation and extreame vnction they vſe other ſignes and formes then euer Chriſt ordained. They teach that Chriſtians are able to ſatiſfie for their ſinnes, and that the Pope by indulgences hath power to remit ſatiſfaction, and to do away the temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne. Are they not then moſt miſerable, that haue corrupted the ſacraments and ſeales of Gods eternall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and as it were broken the couenants betwixt God and vs, and deſpiſed the pledges of his loue?</p>
                  <p>Of Chriſtian faith they thinke ſo baſely, that they make it nothing but a bare aſſent to Gods word, as well in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the threatnings of the law, as beléeuing the promiſes of the Goſpell; &amp; teach that not only reprobate men, but alſo the diuels alſo may haue true faith. <hi>Bellarmine <hi>lib. de iuſtif.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</hi> ſpeaking of the faith of wicked men and diuels, ſayth, <hi>that both is true and right, and catholike faith,</hi> and compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>S.

                  <p>They denie that a man is certainly to perſwade himſelf of his owne ſaluation, or to beléeue the ſame, and all their confidence they put in their owne workes and merites, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to be ſaued by pilgrimages, indulgences, eating of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madaes, créeping to the croſſe, kiſſing of the Popes toe, praying to ſaints, to ſtockes, to ſtones, giuing of money to lazie Monkes and Friers, and ſuch like humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes.</p>
                  <p>Are they not then moſt wretched, that neither vnderſtand what is grace, nor what is faith, nor what is charitie, nor

By holy water they teach, that not onely diuels are driuen away, but alſo veniall ſinnes remitted. Finally, there remaine but few points of religion which the Papiſts with their leuen, partly of Iudaical and heatheniſh ſuperſtition, and partly of hereticall doctrine haue not corrupted. What then reſteth, but that we deplore their blindneſſe which admit ſuch erronious, abſurd, and blaſphemous points of doctrine, and wilfully reſiſt thoſe that offer vnto them the truth out of Gods word?</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The miſerable ſtate of Papiſts in matters of Religion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued further, for that they are depriued of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which we haue receiued by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of popiſh hereſies and ſuperſtition.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Do not thinke but that our aduerſaries, albeit they differ from vs in other points, yet in this will ioyne with vs, and confeſſe that it is a miſerable thing to wander without any certaintie in religion. <hi>Parſons</hi> in the firſt encounter of his Wardword doth in effect ſay ſo much: and albeit they ſhould denie it, yet it is a matter very euident. For as the Apoſtle ſayth <hi>Rom. 2. Thoſe that ſinne without the law, ſhall periſh alſo without the law.</hi> If they know the law, and do it not, the law will accuſe them and condemne them. If they
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18556:87"/> regard not to know the law, yet ſhall Gods iuſtice lay hold vpon them for offending the law, which they ought to haue knowne. The Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ. 2.</hi> when he would put them in mind of their miſerable eſtate before their conuerſion, ſaith <hi>they liued without Chriſt and without God in the world.</hi> As if nothing can be deuiſed more damnable, then to liue with out certaine knowledge of God and of Chriſt Ieſus. <hi>The Gentiles</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Epheſ. 4.) walke in the vanitie of their mind, hauing their vnderſtanding darkned, and being ſtrangers from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the hardneſſe of their heart:</hi> which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the miſerable ſtate of Chriſtians, that liue like Gentils without the true knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus. God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appointed a certaine miniſterie in the Church, giuing ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Euangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and teachers, and among the reſt one end was, <hi>that henceforth we ſhould be no more children, wauering and carried about with euery wind of doctrine.</hi> But the Papiſts, for the moſt part, as is ſhewed, liue without the knowledge of God, and the reſt are caried about with the blaſt of euery blundering Pope, &amp; wauering as the wind of his bluſtring bulles and decretals do carie them. Vpon the Scriptures they ground not themſelues, but muſt take both ſuch ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ſuch doctrine, as he ſhall deliuer them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a miſerable thing to be deuided from the vnitie of Chriſt his Church. For as out of the arke of <hi>Noe</hi> all periſhed in the old world; ſo all that are without the Church of Chriſt, ſhall vndoubtedly periſh. Thoſe ſheepe that are without Chriſt his fold, are expoſed to the mercie of the wolfe, and without hope of ſaluation. How then can the Papiſts looke for ſaluation, that in faith and ſacraments are deuided from the Catholicke and Apoſtolicke Church? Further, by many properties they ſhew themſelues to haue no affinitie with the true Church, as before I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, without true faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. The ſame is the doore, by which we enter into the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18556:88"/> kingdome of heauen. But we haue ſhewed, that in many points the Papiſts haue declined from the true faith. What hope then can they haue either to enter into the kingdom of heauen, or to pleaſe God? How hapneth it they ſee not their wretched ſtate? <hi>Abſque notitia ſui Creatoris, omnis homo pecus eſt: <hi>Without the knowledge of God, a man is no better then a beaſt,</hi>
                     </hi> ſaith <hi>Hierome epiſt. 3.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Sacraments are the ſeales of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament betwixt God and vs. Our Sauior taking the cup at his laſt ſupper, called it <hi>The new Teſtament in his bloud.</hi> If then the Papiſts haue violated Chriſt his inſtitution, in their doctrine and miniſtration of ſacraments, as by diuers arguments we haue declared; then haue they declared themſelues vnworthy to be partakers of his couenant.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Thoſe which deſpiſe the Lord, ſhall themſelues be deſpiſed,</hi> ſaith the Lord <hi>1. Sam. 2.</hi> And as he promiſeth bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to thoſe that worſhip him, and kéepe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; ſo he threatneth curſings to thoſe that refuſe to heare the voice of the Lord, and to kéepe his commaundents and ceremonies preſcribed for his worſhip. <hi>Quod ſi audire nolue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris vocem Domini Dei tui, vt cuſtodias &amp; facias omnia mandata eius &amp; caeremonias, quas ego praecipio tibi hodiè, venient ſuper te omnes maledictiones &amp; apprehendent te,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moyſes Deut. 28.</hi> Let the Papiſts then conſider well with themſelues what they haue done, in tranſforming the worſhip of God into the worſhip of creatures, and ſeruing him not, as he hath appointed, but according to their owne deuiſes and fancies: and let them beware that theſe plagues &amp; curſes ouertake them not, ſéeing they haue wholy neglected the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Strange tongues are for a ſigne</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>1. Cor. 14.) not to them that beleeue, but to them that beleeue not.</hi> The Prophet alſo threatneth as a plague, that God wil ſpeake to his people by men of other tongues, and in ſtrange languages.<note place="margin">Iſay 28.</note> 
                     <hi>In loquela labij, &amp; lingua altera loquetur ad populum iſtum.</hi> It is therefore ſtrange that the Papiſts féele not the hand of God vpon them, when they heare ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18556:88"/> read, and prayers ſaid publikely in a language, which they vnderſtand not: and a thing to be wondred at, that they chuſe rather to liue in this blindneſſe, then to haue the word of God read in a toung which they are able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and whereby they may learne to feare God.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, the very heathen haue oft times choſen to die, rather then to ſée themſelues oppreſſed by tyrants. Yet ſuch is the ſtupiditie of Papiſts, that they ſuffer the Pope and his Prieſts to tyrannize ouer them, loading their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with intolerable lawes and falſe doctrine, and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their goods by diuers kinds of exactions, and endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their liues by their Inquiſitors, and maſſacrers, and ſuch like executioners of their bloudie decrées.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> Moſt dangerous is euery diuiſion among thoſe of one ſocietie, but moſt miſerable it is, when they which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues to be of Gods Church, are deuided one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another. For the Church is a houſe of vnitie, and not of diſſention. But among Papiſts one holdeth of <hi>Benet,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Francis,</hi> another of <hi>Dominicke,</hi> another of <hi>Clare:</hi> and in no point of doctrine do all their Doctors agree together. Superſtitiouſly alſo they obſerue dayes, times, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of meates, and conſecrate ſalt, water, bread, candles, and paſchal Lambes. Finally, they leaue the Creator, and ſerue our Ladie, Angels, and Saints, and other creatures. Nay, for reliques of Saints they worſhip oft times the aſhes, relikes and bones of wicked men and reprobates; nay, of bruite beaſts.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> It is an vnſéemely thing for thoſe, that profeſſe holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſhew themſelues examples of all beaſtlineſſe, as the Popes and holieſt men of the papiſts are wont to do. Therefore ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dogs, ſorcerers, whore-mongers, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, idolaters, and lyars ſhall be ſhut out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, they are not to looke to be admitted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpéedie reformation.</p>

                     <hi>10.</hi> No Prince liuing vnder the Pope can aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of his ſtate: nor can any ſubiect, that liueth vnder ſuch a prince aſſure himſelfe either of his life, or goods. For if
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18556:89"/> the Pope haue power to take away kingdomes, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them vpon others: how can any King or prince aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe he will not attempt the ſame, when occaſion ſerueth, conſidering his violent procéeding againſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and kings in time paſt, and againſt our late noble Queene, againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the third and fourth of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and diuers others? And if euery one by him and his Inquiſitors declared Hereticke, is to loſe life and goods; who can aſſure himſelfe of either, if he acknowledge not his authoritie, and refuſe his religion?</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11.</hi> No man certes ſhall proſper, that ſhall follow An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts ſect or religion: <hi>If any man worſhip the beaſt, and his image,</hi> (ſaith the Angel <hi>Apocalypſ. 14.) and receiue his marke in his forehead, and in his hand, the ſame ſhall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, of the pure wine that is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the cuppe of his wrath.</hi> But that new <hi>Rome</hi> and the Popes gouernment is the image of the old <hi>Romaine</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and that the Pope is <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> it plainely appeareth by diuers arguments, which I haue declared in my fifth booke <hi>De pontif. Rom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>12</hi> Thoſe Kings that liue vnder the Pope, are but halfe kings. For firſt, their Cleargie in diuers caſes is exempt from them, and next they haue not to do with the reſt of their ſubiects in eccleſiaſticall cauſes. O miſerable kings, that haue fallen downe to worſhip the beaſt, and haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch baſe bougerly <hi>Italians</hi> to take away more then halfe of their royall authoritie!</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <hi>13</hi> We find that no kingdome can long liue in peace, which is ſubiect to the Popes controlment. For if the Pope do find himſelfe aggréeued, then doth he trouble the peace of the State; if the ſame offend him not, but pay what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth: yet if he fall out with others, then muſt that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome make warres at the Popes pleaſure. By the Popes ſolicitation both <hi>England, France, Flaunders, Spaine,</hi> and all Chriſtian countries haue endured great troubles. The <hi>Turkes</hi> liue farre more quietly vnder their <hi>Sultans,</hi> then Papiſts vnder the Pope.</p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:18556:89"/>
                  <p>Finally, conſidering the intolerable exactions of the Pope, and his furious inclination to warre and bloudſhed, and the tyrannie both of the Pope and his adherents: it is no maruell, if the papiſticall people be poore, and much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. Whether then we reſpect things of this life, or of the life to come, there is no creature more miſerable then a Papiſt. Do you not then wonder, that any ſhould like the popiſh gouernment? It were certainely much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, but that experience doth teach vs, that the <hi>Cimmeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that dwell in darkneſſe care not for the light, and that brutiſh beaſts delight in brutiſhneſſe, and baſe people in ſeruitude, and ſuperſtitious people in vanities and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the ſeruile and wretched ſtate of the Engliſh nation, vnder the raigne of Queene Mary, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of all people liuing vnder the Popes lawes and religion.</head>
                  <p>HAuing at full diſcourſed concerning matters Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, it followeth now, that I ſpeake of matters touching the ſtate politike, beginning firſt with our owne nation vnder the vnhappie raigne of Quéene <hi>Marie,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Quéene of <hi>England,</hi> and then touching other Princes and States, that are ſubiect to the thraldome of the Pope and his Babyloniſh religion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then it is apparent, that ſhe brought her ſelfe and her people into danger, by reaſon of her match with king <hi>Philip:</hi> and no queſtion but ſhe had brought this kingdome into ſubiection, if not into ſeruile bondage, if God had not croſſed the deſeignes of man, and dealt mercifully with vs, both taking away the Quéene in the ſtrength of her age, and preuenting the wicked counſels of bloudie traitours and perſecutours,<note place="margin">In Orat. ad Eliz.</note> who (as <hi>Iohn Hales</hi> ſaith) meant to haue brought this land vnder ſtrangers: and altering the State before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Spaniards</hi> had taken any firme footing in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:18556:93"/>
                  <p>How great danger this land ſtood in, thoſe that then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued may well remember, and we cannot chuſe but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if we looke backe and conſider the working of Quéen <hi>Marie,</hi> of the popiſh prelates, and of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Quéene ſought by all meanes to put the kingdome into the hands of king <hi>Philip.</hi> The popiſh prelates ſought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe religion, which could not be without the oppreſſion of our libertie. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ruled inſolently, and went about to make themſelues ſtrong, aduancing thoſe which were of their faction, and thruſting backe all, that were ſtudious of their countries libertie. The bulwarkes or blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſes, that were made for defence of the land againſt ſtrangers, they ſuffered to fall: they brought in ſtrangers; they put the commaund of the kingdome into the hands of ſuch as were beſt affectioned to themſelues, and leaſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of their countries libertie.</p>
                  <p>What would haue enſued of this, it is an eaſie matter to coniecture by the deportment of <hi>Spaniards</hi> in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that are ſubiect to their gouernment.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Indiaes</hi> they rule not like men, but rather like barbarous tyrants and ſauage beaſts. <hi>Contemning all iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to king Philip.</note> (ſaith <hi>Bartholomaeus à caſas</hi> writing of the cruel vſage of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> towards the <hi>Indians) they delight to ſee ſtreames of mans bloud, which they haue ſhed, and ſeeke with infinite ſlaughter to depriue thoſe great countries of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inhabitants thereof.</hi> In ſhort ſpace they killed diuers hundred thouſands, onely in one Iland called <hi>Hiſpaniola:</hi> the women they abuſed, the treaſure and commodities of the countrie they ſpoiled.</p>
                  <p>The people of <hi>Naples</hi> were in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, who otherwiſe was a good prince, ſo vexed and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> as an Ambaſſadour of the people of <hi>Siena</hi> ſaid to <hi>Henry</hi> the French king,<note place="margin">Nat. Com. hiſt. lib. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>that for releaſe of their extreame bondage they ſeemed deſirous to liue vnder the Turke: <hi>Vt Turcarum imperia ad tantarum miſeriarum refugium exoptare videantur.</hi>
                     </hi> He ſaith further, that the <hi>Spaniards laid ſo many grieuous tributes vpon the people, that diuers aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18556:94"/> townes were thereby deformed, and left deſolate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Dutchie of <hi>Milan</hi> alſo by the Spaniſh tyrannie, as thoſe that haue trauelled that countrie do know, is brought to great pouertie. The taxes and cuſtomes are grieuous, the oppreſſions wrought by the ſouldiers many, the lawes vnſupportable. Neither doth it auaile them to complaine. For that remedie they haue often tried, but all in vaine. But no people was euer more oppreſſed, then the <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, Brabanſons, Hollanders</hi> and other nations of the Low countries. Their liberties they haue diſanulled, their lawes they haue litle regarded, their townes they haue ſpoiled, their countrie they haue almoſt waſted. By the fundamentall lawes of the countrie, they might neither place ſtrange gouernours ouer them, nor bring in forraine forces among them. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue done both. By the lawes, the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> could neither impoſe taxes vpon the ſubiect, without the conſent of the States, nor condemne any man, but by the lawes of the countrie. But he hath both done the one and the other. The Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> without the conſent of the States, or order, required the hundreth part of that which euery man was worth, and the tenth of all things bought and ſold in the countrie. The noble Earles of <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Horne,</hi> and diuers No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men of the countrie, that had done him great ſeruice, he cauſed to be done to ſhameful death. The prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> eldeſt ſonne, contrarie to the lawes of the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Louain</hi> and countrie, he cauſed to be caried priſoner into <hi>Spaine.</hi> Finally, contrarie to the lawes of the countrie he altered the eccleſiaſticall State making new Biſhops, and erecting new offices of inquiſition in diuers places of the countrie And this the king did,<note place="margin">Ludouic. Guicciard. de Paeſi baſſi.</note> hauing ſworne to obſerue the lawes and priuiledges of the countrie. I will not here recount the murthers, rapes, robberies, thefts, ſpoiles, and wrongs which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſouldiers and officers haue committed. For that would require a great volume, and it would be ſaid, that theſe are the calamities of warres, and wrongs of priuate perſons. Yet if <hi>Spaniards</hi> bring warres
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18556:94"/> and calamities with them, and ſée not theſe wrongs redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: it ſheweth how much their tyrannicall gouernement is to be auoided and deteſted. But that is made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by the lawes and procéedings, which are publikely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portingals</hi> may be an example to all nations, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make the Spaniſh gouernement odious. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be neare neighbors, and agrée with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in Religion, language, lawes and humors; yet haue they not found any more fauour at their hands, then other nations. Their Nobilitie is almoſt ouerthrowne, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant decayed, the Commons ſpoyled. The exactions are intolerable, and yet farre more tolerable then the wrongs offered by Spaniards, from whom neither the huſband can kéepe his wife, nor the father his daughter, nor the citizen or countriman any thing he hath. Adde hereunto the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that is offered to mens perſons, and the iniuries of words that they dayly ſuſtaine; and then you will confeſſe, that the <hi>Portingals</hi> liue in great miſery and bondage.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>England</hi> alſo the Spaniards, albeit but few, began to play their partes, offering violence to diuers mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and attempting the chaſtitie both of matrons and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. In the parliament, which is the foundation of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of our nation, they attempted the ouerthrow of our libertie, not onely by conioyning king <hi>Philip</hi> with the Quéene, but alſo leauing out the Quéenes title of ſupreme authoritie in the ſummons, and taking away the frée electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Commons in chuſing their Burgeſſes, and thruſting out Biſhop <hi>Watſon, Alexander Nowell,</hi> and diuers Burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes out of the parliament.</p>
                  <p>Nay ſuch is the rigor of the Spaniſh gouernement, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelues cannot well like it. The priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Aragon,</hi> the laſt king abrogated vpon pretenſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the fact of <hi>Antony Perez. Eſcouedoes</hi> ſonnes could neuer haue iuſtice for the death of their father. Murders and violences are rarely puniſhed. The taxes, cuſtomes and payments are ſo grieuous, that notwithſtanding all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18556:95"/> that commeth from the Indiaes, nothing can be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more bare, poore and miſerable, then the common ſort of Spaniards. The impoſition vpon fiſh, wine, oile and ſilkes, which are the principal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of the country, is great: and other cuſtomes are not eaſie. In the market the tenth penie is exacted commonly for all commodities bought and ſold.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if we reſpect nothing elſe but the yoke of the Spaniſh gouernement, we may account our nation in very miſerable termes in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes.</p>
                  <p>Yet was not that all the miſchiefe ſhe brought with her. For beſide the yoke of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſhe put vpon her ſubiects the yoke of the Popes tyrannie, and of his <hi>Italians,</hi> relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing the firſt fruits and tenths of Eccleſiaſtical liuings to the Pope, and making her people ſubiect to all his extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and pillages: which not onely to this nation, but alſo to all Chriſtians hath alwayes bene very grieuous.</p>

                  <p>The Engliſh nation complained to the Pope in the ſynod at <hi>Lyon</hi> in the dayes of king <hi>Henry</hi> the third,<note place="margin">Math.

The Emperour,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> as <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> teſtifieth, found fault with the King of <hi>England, for that he ſuffered his countrey to be impoueriſhed ſo ſhamefully by the Pope. <hi>Imperator reprehendit regem Angliae</hi>
                     </hi> (ſaith <hi>Mathew Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris) <hi>quod permitteret terram ſuam tam impudenter per Papam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pauperari.</hi>
                     </hi> If we account the tenths, firſt fruites, rents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of diſpenſations about Eccleſiaſticall benefices, for mariages and vowes, money for licences to eate fleſh and white meates, to kéepe concubines, to erect new ſocieties and orders of Friers, money for indulgences and pardons, canonizations of ſaints, erecting of Churches, for reſcripts of iuſtice, for abſolution from othes, for ſale of Maſſes, and ſuch like Babyloniſh merchandize: we ſhall find that the ſumme doth farre excéed <hi>Bonners</hi> accompt. So iniurious was the Pope in extorting, and ſo patient was this land in bearing all burdens, that worthily it deſerued to be called <hi>the Popes aſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay ſuch corruption was entred into the Romiſh church, that no act of religion could be executed without paying ſomewhat. At chriſtening they paid a chriſme cloth; at bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, a herſe cloth. Neither could any be maried, or houſled, or abſolued, but ſomewhat was paid. At Candlemaſſe they offered candles, at another day bread, and becauſe bread would not downe without drinke, they offered alſo good ale in ſome places. By theſe meanes the prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon the poore mans labour, and got the huſbandmans cow, the artificers inſtruments, and what euery man had, from the owners: and preſſed the very marrow out of the common peoples bones.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe pillages, from which king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of famous memorie, and his ſonne king <hi>Edward</hi> had fréed vs, Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> did make her people ſubiect.</p>
                  <p>She alſo put her people vnder the bloodie hands of the butcherly Romiſh inquiſitors <hi>Bonner, Gardiner, Storie,</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:18556:96"/> and their fellowes: which contrary to iuſtice, and all good forme of proceeding, cauſed foure or fiue hundred to be put to moſt cruell death in a ſhort ſpace, and were the occaſion of the death of many hundreds more, that either for want, or by diſeaſes died, being driuen to leaue their houſes, and to ſhift for themſelues. Some alſo died in priſon, before they came to their triall. Whoſoeuer would not forſake the truth, was driuen to forſake his countrey, kinred &amp; friends, and to flie into ſtrange countries for ſuccor. So we ſée murder, tortures, baniſhments, bands and perſecution of Gods ſaints were the monuments of her raigne.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it pleaſed God to afflict this countrey with a great penury and dearth: the like was not heard of for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares before, nor ſince. Our hiſtories ſay, that wheate was for foure markes the quarter, and mault for <hi>44.</hi> ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: which, conſidering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rate of things, is twiſe or thriſe ſo much as that ſumme amounteth vnto now. Hereupon it came to paſſe, that the people were conſtrained to make bread of acornes, that had refuſed the bread of Gods word, and that many died for extreme want and penury: and yet was not the country halfe ſo populous as now.</p>
                  <p>Finally, to her perpetuall diſhonor, and the ſhame of all Papiſts, ſhe loſt <hi>Calice, Ghines,</hi> &amp; whatſoeuer by the kings of <hi>England</hi> was left her in <hi>France.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the third that moſt victorious prince wanne <hi>Calice:</hi> and ſhe like a moſt diſaſtrous Quéene loſt it: neither did any thing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that ſhe tooke in hand. In the beginning of her raigne ſhe was driuen to flie into <hi>Suffolke</hi> diſguiſed, and had by all likelihood loſt both her life, crowne and hope, if the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Goſpell of <hi>Norfolke</hi> and <hi>Suffolke</hi> had not reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto her, and defended her againſt thoſe that purſued her: for the which ſhe promiſed them liberally, but perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nothing. They deliuered her from danger, and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her promiſe, deliuered them vp to the bloudy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners to be purſued with fire and fagot.</p>
                  <p>She maried with a ſtranger, to the great diſlike of all true hearted Engliſhmen. But well was ſhe requited. For her
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18556:96"/> huſband neuer did well like her, and in the end he went from her, and did in a manner forſake her.</p>
                  <p>Great hope ſhe had to leaue vs a king of her owne body to raigne after her; but her expectation was turned into a mockerie, and all the Maſſes ſaid, and prayers deuiſed, and offerings to Saints relikes, for her ſafe deliuerie, tooke no effect. The ſaying of the Prophet <hi>(Pſal. 7.)</hi> was fulfilled in her. <hi>She conceiued griefe and brought foorth iniquitie. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit dolorem, &amp; peperit iniquitatem.</hi> Salomon</hi> for that he was a iuſt Prince, <hi>had a ſonne giuen him to ſit vpon his throne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him,</hi> as we reade <hi>1. King. 3.</hi> Was not then this merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Quéene iuſtly puniſhed with barrenneſſe, for making ſo many childleſſe?</p>
                  <p>Without cauſe ſhe fell at variance with the French, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into her huſbands quarrell. But ſhe ſpent her labour and treaſure in vaine, left the ſtate in debt, and loſt all ſhe did aduenture for.</p>
                  <p>At the ſea ſhe was moſt vnhappie, loſing a goodly ſhippe called <hi>The great Harrie,</hi> by fire, and hauing no ſucceſſe in any thing. And ſo it appeareth, that ſhe liued and died diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully, leauing no memorie behind her, but of cruell perſecution, of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſlauerie, and of diſgrace, diſhonor, and loſſe to our nation. Neither doth any accompt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of her, then as of a woman vnhappie in her mariage, cruell in perſecuting Gods Saints, vngratefull to thoſe that were her beſt friends, vnkind to her ſubiects, diſaſtrons in all her enterpriſes.</p>
                  <p>The like ſucceſſe had thoſe kings of <hi>England,</hi> that were moſt forward in the Popes ſeruice. Before king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time the Popes agents had litle to do in <hi>England.</hi> He was the firſt that gaue them grace. But ſée his reward. The Pope maintained <hi>Becket</hi> and other his rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects againſt him, and forced him to moſt diſgracefull and baſe conditions of agréement. Furthermore the Popes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in his time found ſuch fauour, that vntill the raigne of king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, this Land could neuer be ridde of them.</p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:18556:97"/>
                  <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt for the Popes pleaſure croſſed him ſelfe for the holy land, and went thither with great forces of men, and royall prouiſions. But nothing he gained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide a vaine name of a valiant man. On the other ſide, his loſſes and diſgraces were excéeding great. For firſt, he loſt moſt of his fléete: then he loſt the beſt part of his men. Thirdly, he loſt diuers good townes in <hi>France,</hi> where his enemies tooke aduantage of his abſence. Fourthly, he was taken priſoner in his returne. Fiftly he impoueriſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his countrie in leauying money for his ranſome. And laſtly, was vnnobly ſlaine before a litle caſtle in <hi>France</hi> by a baſe fellow. So litle did the Popes pardons and bleſſings auaile him.</p>
                  <p>Neuer did any king of <hi>England</hi> more for the Pope then king <hi>Iohn.</hi> For he reſigned his Crowne into his Legates hands, and indeuoured alſo as much as in him lay, to make his kingdome tributarie to the Pope. Let vs then ſée what fruite he reaped of his deuotion to the Pope. Firſt, he liued in continuall iarre with his ſubiects. Secondly, he loſt <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> and diuers townes of great moment, to the <hi>French.</hi> Thirdly, in his dayes the <hi>French</hi> made warre vpon him in <hi>England,</hi> and bid him baſe at his owne doores. Fourthly, he ſuffered his kingdome to be pillaged by the Pope. Finally, he died of poyſon miniſtred to him by a Monke of <hi>Swinſted</hi> Abbey, as <hi>Caxtons</hi> Chronicle reporteth.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the third was flatly couſened by <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth, and deluded with a promiſe of the kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> for his ſonne <hi>Edmond.</hi> But for this vaine title he payed full deare, not onely ſuffering the Pope to ſpoile his countrie, but alſo paying himſelfe great ſummes to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, for the deliuerance of <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth, ſpent infinit treaſure vainely. And that was the ſucceſſe of all the kings of <hi>England</hi> that did ſeruice to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Generally, all thoſe that liue vnder the Popes iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, liue moſt miſerably, being neither ſecured for their
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18556:97"/> goods, nor liues, nor liberties, either from their neighbour princes, or from the Pope. Firſt, they ſerue two kings, whereſoeuer they liue: that is, their King or Duke, and the Pope. If they offend the Pope, they are proclaimed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, and are déemed worthie of death, yea albeit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie be no matter of Religion. <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bauier</hi> and his followers were reputed heretikes, he for taking on him the Empire without the Popes allowance, theſe for yéelding obedience to their lawfull prince. The like cenſure was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt all that followed the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>If they offend their Princes, either in word or act, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie is death. <hi>Poggio</hi> ſheweth, that a rich man being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of treaſon, anſwered, that he had not offended, but if his goods had offended, he would not conſent with them. And thus by renouncing that which he had, he eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>The lawes are very rigorous both of Pope and popiſh princes, the executions very cruell and barbarous. <hi>Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius</hi> ſpeaking of the times of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, ſaith, that <hi>there was neuer more outrages committed by Spadaſſins and cut throates: that the people of Rome had neuer leſſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: that there was a great number of priuie promoters, and that euery euill word was puniſhed with death.</hi> But this is common to all Italian princes. Murthers and ſpoiles are litle regarded, euery word, nay euery thought againſt them if it be knowne, is puniſhed moſt rigorouſly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> inquiſitors in crueltie paſſe moſt ſauage beaſtes. Vpon euery light ſurmiſe they procéed againſt moſt innocent perſons, and ſome they racke, ſome they famiſh, ſome they burne, ſome they cut péecemeale.

                  <p>What by colour of law, and what without law, the Pope and his ſhauelings do ſpoyle the whole Chriſtian common wealth. The gaine of the Popes faculties, and of popiſh pardons, Maſſes, and dirges, and other ſuch like pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall wares and commodities, amounteth to a great maſſe of money. Therewith the Pope maketh warres, the Maſſe-prieſts and Friers maintaine themſelues, and their bagga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and all their pompous traine and brauery.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while the poore people wring, that beare moſt of this charge. Further, they are bound to prouide the furniture of altars, images, Churches, and all that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Maſſes. In a certaine viſitation at <hi>Como,</hi> by the Popes legate called <hi>Bonhomme</hi> ſo many particulars are commaunded to be prouided,<note place="margin">The Acts of that viſitation were printed at Collein. anno 1585.</note> as could not in ſeauen leaues be comprehended. In <hi>Spaine</hi> euery man of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort is compelled to buy two indulgences; the one for the quicke, the other for the dead. The common rate of a pardon they ſay is foure reals of plate. If the executors wil
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18556:99"/> not be at the charge of a funerall, they vſe to compell the parties.</p>
                  <p>The Pope to get money in his owne territorie beſide all this raiſeth new cuſtomes and impoſitions dayly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a monopoly of whores, and hath ordinarie bankes of vſury, as the world knoweth, and popiſh writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, where they ſpeake of their <hi>Monti di pieta.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore God doth puniſh them often with warres, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſickneſſe and famine, and other vſitations. In <hi>Spaine</hi> it is an ordinary matter to ſee the people die of famine.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18556:100"/> in a blanke booke.

But in his warres he behaued himſelf ſo manfully, that thinking to ſubdue the Low cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries by force, which yéelded vnto him for loue, in the end he loſt halfe of that which he poſſeſſed before. Purpoſing to make a conqueſt of <hi>England,</hi> he was himſelfe conquered and ouercome by a woman. Bragging of his inuincible fleete, he found himſelfe and his fléete vanquiſhed by ſmall forces.

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> That no king liuing vnder the Pope, and receiuing his doctrine, can aſſure himſelfe of his kingdome.</head>
                  <p>THat the yoke of Antichriſtian and popiſh gouernment is grieuous and intolerable to all Chriſtians, we haue made it apparent by diuers particulars. But could any Chriſtian indure it; yet Chriſtian Kings and Princes haue leaſt reaſon to do it. For as their place is higher then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo the diſhonor that is offered to them, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard which they incurre, is of farre greater conſideration, then if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſhould be offered to priuate perſons. And yet no man runneth into greater hazard, nor receiueth greater wrongs at the Popes hands, and by means of his doctrine and gouernment, then Chriſtian Kings and princes. For firſt they are in no aſſurance of their ſtate: and ſecondly, they runne in daunger to loſe their liues, if they receiue the Popes authoritie and doctrine within their kingdomes: Of which two we will ſpeake ſeuerally and in order.</p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:18556:102"/>
                  <p>That they ſtand in no aſſurance of their ſtates, it may be proued, firſt, by the Popes doctrine: and ſecondly, by their practiſe. Their doctrine is cleare both by the Popes decretals, and by the common opinions of their principall Doctors. <hi>Clement</hi> the fift in the Chapter beginning <hi>Romani de iureiurando.</hi> declareth, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours take an oath of fealtie and ſubiection to the Pope. <hi>Romani prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>orthodoxae fidei profeſſores, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of Rome profeſſing the faith, with feruour of faith and readie deuotion honoring the holy church of Rome, whoſe head is Chriſt our Redeemer, and the Biſhop of Rome our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers Vicar, haue not thought it an indignitie to ſubmit their heades, and to bind themſelues by oath, from whom they haue receiued, not onely the approbation of their perſon aſſumed vnto the imperiall dignitie, but alſo vnction, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and the crowne of the Empire.</hi> But if the Emperor receiue his Empire from the Pope, then may he be depoſed by the Pope. And if he take an eath of fealtie and obedience to the Pope, then is he forſworne, if he obey not his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and cenſures, as the Canoniſts teach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Clem. Rom. de iureiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando.</note>Likewiſe the ſame Pope affirmeth, that the Emperor is bound by oath to roote out the enemies of the Romiſh church, and not to make any confederation or league with any enemie of the Pope, or any ſuſpected vnto him. Which being graunted, it followeth, that no King or Emperour can make peace with others, then ſuch as the Pope liketh, and that he is to make warres vpon ſuch as he miſliketh. A matter which now preſently much concerneth all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. For if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or other the Popes vaſſals haue reſpect to this law, as no queſtion but they haue, then all capitulations betwixt them, and Chriſtian princes of our profeſſion are made by his diſpenſation, and to hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then it ſhall ſtand with the Popes good liking.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the gloſſe vpon the ſame chapter doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo plainely declare, that the Emperour is ſubiect to the Pope. <hi>Modo quaero,</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>nonne Ieſus voluit, &amp;c. <hi>Now I aske</hi>
                     </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether Chriſt Ieſus would not, that theſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18556:102"/> Princes, to whom he hath giuen temporall iuriſdiction, &amp;c. ſhould be in ſome ſort ſubiect vnto his Vicar, that is, to the Biſhop of Rome: and whether he would not, that theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould giue oath to the Biſhop of Rome; and whether he would not, that they ſhould ſubmit their heads to the ſame Biſhop. VVhereunto Clement aunſwereth in the text, that they ſhould.</hi> And very plaine it is, that this was the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Clement,</hi> ſéeing he determineth, that the Emperor ought to take an oath <hi>of ſealtie and obedience: <hi>fidelitatis &amp; obedientiae:</hi>
                     </hi> but if he ſweare fealtie and obedience, then is he to ſhew himſelfe obedient, and the Pope may puniſh him, if he ſweare falſe. So we ſée, that if the Popes law hold, then the Emperor for his Empire is tenant at the Popes will, and may hold it no longer, then he continueth in his obedience, vnleſſe he will either refuſe to ſweare, or be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne.</p>
                  <p>In the chapter <hi>Paſtoralis Clement. de ſent. &amp; re indicata:</hi> the Pope declareth, <hi>that he hath ſuperioritie ouer the Empire, and that in the vacancie of the Empire himſelfe ought to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Emperour.</hi> Thereupon alſo he contradicteth the Emperors procéeding, and declareth the Emperours ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt <hi>Robert</hi> king of <hi>Sicilie</hi> to be void, and without effect. But if the Emperour cannot procéede againſt rebels, but that his ſentence ſhall be reuerſed by the Pope; then is he the Popes vaſſall and ſubiect, and cannot longer hold the crowne, then it ſhall pleaſe the Pope. Neither may other princes looke for greater fauour at the Popes hands, then the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight in the Chapter, <hi>Vnam ſanctam. extr. com. de maiorit. &amp; obedient.</hi> doth expreſſely determine, that the Pope hath both ſwords, and that he hath power both to make kings, and to depoſe them. <hi>Spiritualis poteſtas pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem terrenam inſtituere habet, &amp; iudicare, ſi bona non fuerit.</hi> That is, <hi>the ſpirituall power hath right to ordaine the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, and to iudge the ſame, if it be not good.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>if the earthly power go aſtray, the ſame muſt be iudged by the ſpirituall power.</hi> That is, by the Pope. But if he haue
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18556:103"/> right to iudge kings; then hath he right to pronounce iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them, and to take their crowne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. This decretal was publiſhed againſt <hi>Philip</hi> the French King, but no doubt, but the Pope taketh himſelfe to haue the ſame right againſt all other kings. Nay, albeit the ſame ſentence ſéemeth to haue bin ſuſpended in regard of the French king by the chapter <hi>Meruit extr. com. de priuilegijs,</hi> yet haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Popes procéeded againſt ſome French Kings, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the third. How may then other Kings hope to eſcape their cenſures that are not priuiledged?</p>
                  <p>Now if any man except and ſay, that this is not the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Rome</hi> that now is, he ſhal ſhew himſelf to be but a nouice, that thinketh that any Papiſt dare depart from the doctrine of his holy fathers decretals. Beſide that, if we ſearch the bookes of late writers, we ſhall find that they do not digreſſe from their elders. <hi>Ioſephus Veſtanus</hi> in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>De oſculatione pedum Pontificis, p. <hi>137.</hi>

But howſoeuer it is, if princes ſtand vpon looſing their crownes at the Popes pleaſure, then are they in poore eſtate, and without any aſſurance of their kingdomes, conſidering eſpecially the malice of the Pope againſt ſuch as profeſſe the truth, and his ambition in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croching vpon his neighbors dominions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ghineard</hi> a Iebuſite was hanged in <hi>Paris anno 1594.</hi> for writing and holding diuers ſeditious poſitions, wherof one was, <hi>that the crowne of France might, and ought to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into another family, then that of Bourbon.</hi> Neither néed any man make queſtion, by whom he meant that this feat ſhould be wrought, ſéeing the Pope is the man, whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> and <hi>Cananites</hi> ſeeke to aduance aboue Kings.</p>
                  <p>Finally, <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> in his <hi>Warnword, part. 2. f. 117.6</hi> alleageth a booke entitled, <hi>De iuſta Henrici tertij abdicatione,</hi> that is, of the iuſt depoſing of the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the third: whereby it is apparent, that he alſo holdeth, that the Pope may iuſtly depoſe Kings. Neither is it likely, that he would ſo buſily haue ſought to ſtirre vp rebels in <hi>England,</hi> and to ſuborne cut-throtes to kill the Quéene, or that he would haue deſired that <hi>Pius</hi> the fift his bull againſt her might be ſuſpended for a time concerning Papiſts, if he had not taken her to be depoſed by the Pope.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this doctrine of the Popes authority, that of it ſelfe is litle worth, would auaile nothing, vnleſſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo can be drawne to fauour the Popes faction; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope and his ſchollers giue alſo a power to the

                     </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuppoſe, that onely tyrannie is a iuſt cauſe of depoſition.</hi> His words ſtand thus: <hi>Poteſt princeps per remp. priuari ob tyrannidem, &amp; ſi non faciat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium ſuum, &amp; cum eſt cauſa aliqua iusta, &amp; alius eligi à maiori parte populi.

                     </hi> True it is, that he ſpeaketh of a tyrant.

                  <p>Frier <hi>Ghineard</hi> a French Iebuſite held, that <hi>Henrie</hi> the French King now liuing was very fauorably dealt withal, <hi>if he were onely depoſed and thruſt into a monaſterie.</hi> The ſame man in diuers poſitions maintaineth the rebellion of the leaguers in <hi>France,</hi> which by force of armes ſought to depoſe their King.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18556:105"/> this is the doctrine, not onely of the Iebuſites, but alſo of al Papiſts that are combined together for the maintenance of the Popes ſeate and faction.</p>

Likewiſe did <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirtéene ſend forces into <hi>Ireland,</hi> together with his legate <hi>Sanders.

                  <p>This therefore is a moſt cleare caſe, that no Chriſtian king can be in ſafetie, as long as he ſuffereth <hi>Iebuſites</hi> and Maſſe-prieſts to aduance the Popes authoritie. and to preach ſeditiouſly, that the people hath power to put Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of their royall ſeate. It is very dangerous alſo to foſter any man within the Realme, that beléeueth this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious doctrine.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that Papiſts caſt many colours to hide the deformities of this doctrine: but theſe colours are eaſily waſhed away, as not being able to abide any weather. Firſt, they alleage, that diuerſe popiſh Princes haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed their kingdomes quietly without moleſtation. But we are able to ſhew more Princes of late time troubled by the Popes practiſes, then they are able to ſhew, to haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued peaceably by them. Furthermore, the reaſon why Popes do not trouble all, is, becauſe it were not ſafe for them to fall out with too many at one time, and not becauſe their ouer large authoritie is not preiudiciall to all. For if the Pope may depoſe all kings vpon cauſe. then all kings ſtand in like danger, ſéeing no man can auoide all cauſes of quarrell.</p>

And if they will not confeſſe it true in Chriſtians of our time: yet can they not deny it in the times of the Emperors, <hi>Henry</hi> the third, fourth, and fifth, of <hi>Fredericke</hi> the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and of <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bauier,</hi> who made ſuch confeſſions of their faith, being declared heretickes, as the Popes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues could not contradict: and yet did the Popes excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them, and ſought to depoſe them as heretikes and tyrants. Likewiſe did they proſecute other kings and Emperours, albeit conſenting with them in matters of faith. <hi>Henrie</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> of late was cruelly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18556:108"/> and murdred by the popiſh faction: and yet was he very ſuperſtitiouſly addicted to popiſh religion. Suppoſe then, that the Pope would procéed againſt none but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes and tyrants; yet it is an eaſie matter and very vſual for him to picke quarels, and to impute hereſie and tyranny and great crimes to moſt innocent men.</p>
                  <p>Finally they may ſay, that the Pope is alwayes aſſiſted by Gods holy ſpirit, and cannot erre in his ſentences of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and depoſing of Princes, eſpecially for matters of religion. But this allegation is moſt brutiſh, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and refuted by euident experience and moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofes that teach vs, that he is rather led by the ſpirit of Sathan, who was a murtherer from the beginning, and is the author of rebellions and troubles, then by the ſpirit of God, that is the God of peace, and author of concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let all Princes that liue vnder the Popes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, conſider well the former reaſons and examples, and look into their owne danger and ſlippery eſtate. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit now the Pope hath his hands full, and cannot or dare not offer them wrong; yet many occaſions may be offered of falling out betwixt them and the Pope. And in that caſe either they muſt confeſſe, as we do, that the Pope is a falſe prophet and Antichriſt; or elſe yéeld vp their Crowne at his pleaſure, or elſe defend their right without lawful title, and that both againſt rebels and forreine enemies: which will be a matter hard for them to do.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> That no King or Prince can ſecure his perſon againſt the attempts of traitors, if he ſuffer any in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that teach or hold the Popes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning the depoſing and killing of Kings.</head>
                  <p>THis corollary or concluſion, is neceſſarily deduced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of Papiſts, concerning the Popes power
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18556:109"/> in depoſing of Kings and Princes. For if it be lawfull for the Pope to depoſe a Prince fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his royall throne, then is it lawfull for the Pope to command any aſſaſſin or cutthrote to murder him, ſéeing it is not likely that a magnanimous King wil yéeld to ſo baſe a companion as the Pope, nor giue vp his Crowne without force and compulſion.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is alſo proued by the general practiſe of Popes, by the wordes of the Popes bulles, by the doctrine of their principall followers, and by diuers particular facts and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts both of Popes and their wicked inſtruments and agents. For firſt we find, that thoſe Popes that haue gone about to depoſe Kings, haue alſo vſed all meanes to deſtroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; to cut their throtes. The which may be verified by the procéeding of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, of <hi>Paſchalis</hi> and <hi>Vrban</hi> againſt his ſonne, of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> againſt <hi>Fridericke Barbaroſſa,</hi> of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Otho,</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth and <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth againſt <hi>Fridericke</hi> the ſecond, of <hi>Clement</hi> the fift againſt <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lucembourg,</hi> whom he cauſed to be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in the ſacrament.

For why did they raiſe rebellion, moue warres, and ſuborne ſecret traitors to attempt againſt the perſons of Kings, but that they meant to giue leaue to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate cutthrotes to kill them?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the words of the Popes buls, and the doctrine of their wicked agents doth notoriouſly manifeſt their leud and damnable purpoſes touching this point.<note place="margin">Platina, in Greg. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>7</hi> doth firſt depriue <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor of his Empire, and forbiddeth his ſubiects to obey him.

But neither could he be depoſed without armes, nor might <hi>Rodolph</hi> be ſuffered to raigne during the life of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> the third in his ſeditious bull againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> king of <hi>England,</hi> commaunded <hi>the Nobles and other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall men of the countrey to oppoſe themſelues with force and armes againſt him, and to caſt him out of his kingdome.</hi> But armes are taken in hand for no other purpoſe then to kil ſuch as reſiſt: and a weake conceit it is to thinke, that king <hi>Henry</hi> could be thruſt out of his kingdome, vnleſſe he were alſo depriued of his life.</p>
                  <p>That impious Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fift alſo, that ſent <hi>Nicholas Norton</hi> to moue an inſurrection againſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and his legate <hi>Sanders</hi> to do the like in <hi>Ireland,</hi> did intend no leſſe then the deſtruction of her perſon, if the rebels had preuailed. In his bull againſt her he declared, that he had authoritie to pull vp and to deſtroy, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her ſubiects to obey her: which could not be executed without her deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixtus</hi> the <hi>5.</hi> in his declaration <hi>anno 1588.</hi> againſt the ſame Quéene, hauing at large rayled with his foule and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy mouth againſt the Lords annointed, exhorteth all her people <hi>to lay hands on her, to arreſt her, and to concurre to her puniſhment.</hi> That is alſo the end of that traitor Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> his ſeditious exhortation to the Nobilitie and people of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> But becauſe the Papiſts had no better ſucceſſe <hi>an. 1588.</hi> therefore they ſuppreſſed this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for very ſhame, leaſt their dealings for the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of princes ſhould be made manifeſt, and leaſt the myſteries of Romiſh <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be reuealed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parſons</hi> that baſtardly Engliſh renegate,<note place="margin">Parſons an abbettor of cutthrotes &amp; King-killers.</note> in his booke of ſucceſſion, <hi>part. 1. cap. 3.</hi> alloweth the depoſition of K. <hi>Iohn,</hi> of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and of diuers violent attempts made by ſubiects againſt their lawfull Kings. Thereby it appeareth alſo, that he approueth warres and rebellions made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Kings, and to deſtroy them. Nay, allowing the violent death of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Senate, he ſeemeth directly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the murder of princes: which is the rather to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18556:110"/> for that he was an agent in the printing, and as his conſorts the Maſſe-prieſts ſay, in making the libell ſet out by <hi>Allen</hi> againſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> proclaiming reward to all that could lay hold vpon her, nay that could kill her.</p>
                  <p>Now leaſt any man ſhould doubt of the doctrine of the infernall Iebuſites in this point,<note place="margin">In verbo Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rann.</note> 
                     <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> in his aphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes for confeſſaries, doth thus inſtruct all Maſſe prieſts: <hi>Tyrannicè gubernans iuſtè acquiſitum dominium, non poteſt ſpolias ſine publico iudicio, lata verò ſententia poteſt quiſque fieri executor:</hi> That is, <hi>he that gouerneth tyrannically his ſtate, which he hath gotten iuſtly, cannot be ſpoyled of it without publicke ſentence</hi> (of the Pope); <hi>but ſentence being paſſed, euery man may execute the ſentence:</hi> he meaneth, that he may kill the King. He ſayth alſo, <hi>that the people haue power to depoſe the prince.</hi> He doth further vnderſtand the Pope to be euery Kings lawfull Iudge. Is it then to be maruelled, if the Maſſe-prieſts and their followers, grounding themſelues vpon theſe reſolutions, attempt againſt princes perſons?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn Ghineard</hi> one of the ſect of the Iebuſites, did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely acknowledge in the parliament of <hi>Paris, anno 1594.</hi> that he had written theſe words: <hi>The cruell Nero</hi> (that is, <hi>Henry</hi> the third) <hi>was ſlaine by one <hi>Clement,</hi> and the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet Monke by the hand of a true Monke.</hi> Againe, <hi>the heroicall act done by <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> as a grace of Gods holy ſpirit, and called by that name by our diuines the Iebuſites, was iuſtly commended by Bourgoin late prior of the Iacobins, a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and martyr.</hi> Talking of the king now raigning, he wrote <hi>that he would haue him ſhut into a cloiſter, and depoſed. But if he cannot be depoſed without warre, then</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>let warre be made againſt him. And if there be no meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile by warres, let him otherwiſe be killed.</hi> I would therfore haue indifferent men to iudge, whether this be not ſpiritual doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Our owne country Maſſe-prieſts alſo do not differ from their fellows in this point. One of them ſetting downe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reſolutions for the inſtruction and conſolation of the Engliſh, as he ſaith, aſketh this queſtion, <hi>Whether a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:18556:110"/> (he ſhould ſay, a trayterous papiſt) <hi>is not bound by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Bull, (of Pius Quintus) to take armes againſt Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, and to depoſe her, impriſon her, and kill her, if occaſion ſhould ſerue, and if he haue hope to obtaine victorie.</hi> To this he anſwereth: <hi>Ex vi Bullae, putamus eum non teneri ad ea quae proponuntur, niſi omnia ita comparata eſſent, vt certa parata<expan>

And this no doubt is the reſolution they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all princes, that reſiſt either the Pope, or their caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like religion. The tenth queſtion is this: <hi>An ſtante Bulla in virtute, &amp;c. <hi>Whether the Bull of Pius Quintus ſtanding in force, a priuate man might not kill Elizabeth,</hi>
                     </hi> (our late Quéene) <hi>and the reaſon is, becauſe ſhe is a tyrant, and had no iuſt title to the Crowne: and whether the Pope cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, that this may be done, ſo it were likely, that by her death, catholike</hi> (they ſhould ſay popiſh) <hi>religion ſhould be reſtored.</hi> To this queſtion anſwer is made: <hi>As touching this matter, if any by her death could certainely deliuer the realme from oppreſſion, without all doubt, it ſhould be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to kill her: but as matters do now ſtand, it is beſt not to ſpeake of that matter.</hi> Hereby we may plainely ſée, that this generation doth continually talk of killing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian kings, and deſire nothing more, then to murther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to deſtroy them, that they may make way for the Pope. Theſe queſtions are found in the acts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and were found in a ſearch for <hi>Dauid Ingleby</hi> a Maſſe-prieſt, and no doubt, were allowed and brought into <hi>England</hi> either by him or by ſome of his conſorts.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18556:112"/> names; yet it is abſurd to thinke, that any would confeſſe a matter againſt himſelfe, and ſet it downe with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumſtances, if there neuer had bene any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter Barriere</hi> was executed not many yeares ſince at <hi>Melun,</hi> for that he was conuinced by diuers witneſſes, and afterward confeſſed that he came to the court of France with a full reſolution to kill the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4.</hi> He confeſſed alſo, that he was animated thereto by a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite,</hi> a <hi>Iacobin,</hi> a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> and a <hi>Iebuſite</hi> at <hi>Lyon,</hi> and that he had conferred with the Curate of <hi>S. Andrew</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> who told him, that he ſhould for this fact be tranſlated into paradiſe, and obtaine great glorie. He talked alſo with the Rector of the colledge of <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> where he receiued the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and with another preaching <hi>Iebuſite,</hi> who (as he ſayd) aſſured him, that his reſolution (viz. for killing the king) was moſt holy and meritorious. Wherefore being conuinced by diuers witneſſes and preſumptions, and by his owne confeſſion, wherein he perſiſted vnto the death, he was by an ordinary courſe of iuſtice condemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. The <hi>Iebuſites</hi> and their followers (I confeſſe) ſay, that he was a light headed fellow. But his anſwers, and the whole proceeding againſt him, which is particularly ſet downe by a Papiſt in the Iebuſites Catechiſme, <hi>lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </hi> doth declare the quite contrary, and proue manifeſtly, that he came to the place with a ful reſolution to do that wicked act, being encouraged thereunto by the <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> and other pillers of the Romiſh Church, that without ſuch execrable murthers cannot ſtand. The ſame alſo proueth, that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in all that cauſe like a man well aduiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn Chaſtel</hi> wounded the French king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth with a knife, and purpoſed to haue cut his throte.<note place="margin">Regiſters of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Paris.</note> After the act being examined, he confeſſed that he had learned by phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which he had ſtudied in the colledge of Iebuſites at <hi>Paris, that it was lawful for to kil the King,</hi> and that he hath often heard the Iebuſites ſay, <hi>that it was lawfull to kill the King, being out of the Church.</hi> In the end perſiſting in his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18556:113"/> confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he was put to death. His maſter alſo which taught him this philoſophie, was baniſhed the Realme of <hi>France.</hi> Finally, the parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> conſidering the ſequele of this damnable doctrine, pronounced the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the king and kingdome, and baniſhed them out of <hi>France,</hi> and cauſed a piller to be crected in the place where <hi>Chaſtels</hi> fathers houſe did ſtand, teſtifying that the <hi>Iebuſites are a pernicious ſect, and enemies to kings.</hi> Gladly would the Iebuſits put away this diſgrace, but it is engraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſtone: and their inſtances and anſwers are ſuch, as rather further blot them, then reléeue them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Crighton</hi> accuſed one <hi>Robert Bruis</hi> before the Count <hi>de Fuentes,</hi> for that he had not murdred a certaine Noble man of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor would diſburſe fiftéene hundred crownes to thrée, that at his ſolicitation had vndertaken that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Such is the violent humor of the <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> and ſo are they tranſported in their paſſions and rage to kill princes.</p>
                  <p>But nothing I ſuppoſe, doth better diſcouer the execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intentions of the wicked Iebuſites and Maſſe-prieſts againſt Kings, then their trecherous practiſes at diuers times attempted againſt Quéene <hi>Elizabeth. Pius Quintus</hi> dealt with the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> by force to ouerthrow her, and ſtirred vp her ſubiects ſecretly to rebell againſt her. <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Quintus an. 1588.</hi> left not off to ſolicite the Spaniſh king againſt her, vntill the Spaniards were ouerthrowne at the ſea, and had their land forces ſcattered. But when warres and open force wrought no good effect, they and their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and adherents ſet murderers and empoyſoners on worke. <hi>Anno 1584. William Parry</hi> vndertooke to kill her: the which reſolution ſo well pleaſed Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the <hi>13.</hi> that Cardinall <hi>Como</hi> in the Popes name, promiſed him pardon of all his ſins, and a great reward beſides for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour. <hi>Monſignor,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>his Holineſſe hath ſeene your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with the credentiall note included, and cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the good diſpoſition, which as you write, you hold for the ſeruice and benefite of the publike weale: wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth you to continue, vntill you haue brought it to effect.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18556:113"/> And that you may be holpen by that good ſpirit that hath moued you, he granteth you his bleſſing, and plenary indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and remiſſion of all your ſinnes, aſſuring you beſide the merite you ſhall haue in heauen, that his Holineſſe will make himſelfe your debtor, to acknowledge your deſerts in the beſt ſort he can, &amp;c.</hi> Where note I pray you, that the Pope pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth heauen, and not only reward in earth to ſuch as deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately aduenture to kill Kings. The ſaid <hi>Parrie</hi> was not onely encouraged by the Pope, but alſo reſolued by <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio</hi> a Iebuſite at <hi>Venice,</hi> and other Iebuſites at <hi>Lyon,</hi> and laſtly by <hi>Anniball Codret</hi> to put his diſſeine in execution. And ſo hauing receiued the ſacrament at <hi>Paris,</hi> he came for <hi>England</hi> with full aſſurance to be made at the leaſt a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, and with a deſperate purpoſe to murder his dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne: matters not onely made manifeſt by witneſſes, and preſumptions, but alſo confeſſed by himſelfe, and recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in publike acts and hiſtories. It appeareth alſo, that <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> whoſe head is now become a mint of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, had a finger in this buſineſſe. His owne letter dated the <hi>18.</hi> of October, <hi>an. 1598.</hi> will conuince him, if he deny it. For therein he confeſſeth, <hi>how when he perceiued that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Engliſh gentleman meant to diſcouer <hi>Parries</hi> practiſe againſt the Queene, that he did diſſwade him, and ſo wrought with the man, that he was content <hi>Parry</hi> ſhould proceed on without being by him bewrayed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When as <hi>D. Gifford</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and other prieſts at <hi>Rhemes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Notes of the practiſes of Iebuſites.</note> had perſwaded <hi>Sauage</hi> to kill the Quéene, as the onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle of their purpoſes; yet did he ſeeme cold in his reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vntill ſuch time as a Ieſuite méeting with him at <hi>Ewe</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> did perſwade him to go on reſolutely, and without doubting.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Ballards</hi> and <hi>Babingtons</hi> conſpiracie tended to the deſtruction of the Quéenes perſon, it cannot be denied. For not onely witneſſes and preſumptions, but alſo their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions declare ſo much. Neither did <hi>Babington</hi> giue ouer his wicked purpoſe being taken, but wrote to <hi>Sauage</hi> by all means to haſten his enterpriſe for the killing of the Quéen:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18556:114"/> which was the cauſe that brought both them and others to their ends.</p>
                  <p>Neither are we to doubt, but that diuers Papiſts of note, both in <hi>England</hi> and other places, knew of this treaſon, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes it was their faſhion, in generall termes at the leaſt, if not in particular maner, to giue notice of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For <hi>Ballard</hi> went ouer of purpoſe to <hi>Paris,</hi> to acquaint <hi>D. Allen</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and others, with his owne and his conſorts determination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Someruile</hi> was ſo reſolute in his purpoſe, and ſo iocund, that he could not kéepe his owne counſell ſecret, but would néedes profeſſe to his friends, <hi>that he was determined to kill the Queene:</hi> but being detected, he wilfully made away him ſelfe, to ſaue the hangmans labor. <hi>Arden</hi> was executed for the ſame treaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir William Stanley</hi> and <hi>Iaques</hi> his Lieutenant, with the helpe of two Ieſuites called <hi>Holt</hi> and <hi>Sherwood,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other traitorous Engliſh Maſſe-prieſts, perſwaded one <hi>Patricke Collen</hi> an Iriſh man, and a deſperate fencer, to go ouer ſecretly into <hi>England</hi> and to murder the Quéen, ſhewing by what means he might do it, without any great danger. To encourage him the better, they gaue him thirty pound ſterling, for to put himſelf in order and to defray his charges, and loaded him with large promiſes of further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and preferment: all which the man being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded did voluntarily confeſſe, as the acts and proceſſe do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and was therefore condemned and adiudged in die.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edmund York</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> being charged with the like treaſon, confeſſed alſo, that partly by the perſwaſion of <hi>Holt</hi> the Iebuſite, who abuſed the conſecrated hoſt, to induce them and reſolue them, and partly vpon hope of an aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fortie thouſand crownes ſhewed them by <hi>Hugh Owen,</hi> they promiſed to vndertake the killing of the Quéen. They ſaid further, that <hi>D. Gifford, D. Worthington,</hi> &amp; that vnworthy knight <hi>Sir William Stanley,</hi> together with diuers other Engliſh fugitiues beyond the ſea, were acquainted
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18556:114"/> with this their reſolution and practiſe, and encoraged them by all meanes to go forward. Afterward, when theſe ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Iebuſites and Maſſe prieſts, and their abbettors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that by the ſword they could not take away the Quéenes life, then they ſet on empoyſoners to do the fait. And that is apparant firſt by the fact and confeſſion of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez</hi> and his conſorts, and next by the treaſon of <hi>Edmund Squire,</hi> and the Iebuſite <hi>Walpoole.</hi> Vnto <hi>Lopez</hi> for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution fiftie thouſand crownes were promiſed: and the onely ſtay of aſſurance, was the ſafetie of the Quéene. The billes of payment directed to <hi>Carrera</hi> and <hi>Pallacio</hi> for the ſumme aforeſayd, are yet extant, and will alway conuince the actors in this moſt execrable attempt of notorious vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walpoole</hi> deliuered a poyſon to <hi>Edmund Squire,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was agréed, that he ſhould annoint the pummell of the Quéenes ſaddle. He coniured the man with all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent adiurations he could deuiſe. He cauſed him to receiue the ſacrament, and to damne himſelfe if he did not both meane truly, and reſolutely execute that which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. In the end he promiſed him the ſtate of a glorious ſaint in heauen, if he died in the performance of the act. The which things the partie himſelfe conſtantly confeſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all torture, and perſiſted in his confeſſion to the end. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle therefore doth it auaile <hi>Martin Aray,</hi> and <hi>Fitherbert,</hi> or rather <hi>Fitzputain, Parſons,</hi> or others to denie it, grounding themſelues vpon the violence of the rackmaſters, as they call them, and the reuocation of his confeſſion at the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. For neither was the man euer put to the racke, nor euer did he recant that which he had ſayd before of <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole</hi> and his practiſe: whereof, the firſt is teſtified by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like acts, the ſecond by infinite witneſſes yet liuing. Are they not then both ſhameleſſe and witleſſe, that vpon méere fancies and heareſayes deny publicke actes, confeſſions of parties, depoſitions of witneſſes, plaine preſumptions, and moſt euident proofes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if Chriſtian princes will either beléeue the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18556:115"/> doctrine and grounds, or looke into the practiſe and procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Satanicall race of king-killers &amp; empoyſoners; I doubt not but they will prudently beware of them, and neither ſuffer them nor their abettors to come néere them, or to remaine within their dominions. If they haue not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto looked into matters, which ſo neere concerne their liues and ſafetie, I pray God they may yet do it in time. Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being a moſt mild prince, was told that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> and his faction thought well of her, and meant her no harme. But wiſe men conſidering the maner of her death, and effects of ſome drugs that are wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerate the mouth, to gréeue the ſtomacke, to bereue men of ſence, to worke a ſtipticity and ſtupidity, and the concourſe, and whiſpering, and preparations of the popiſh faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of her ſickneſſe, do much feare that ſhe was not well dealt withall. I pray God reueale the truth, and grant al others by her example to beware of the Popes and Iebuſits moſt dangerous practiſes, which neuer ceaſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king miſchiefe if they may haue fit oportunitie.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> That kings and Princes liuing in ſubiection to the Pope, are but halfe kings, and demi-princes.</head>
                  <p>BVt ſuppoſe the Pope and his conſpiring and working crew, ſhould neither attempt to take away the crowne, nor the life from a prince, that beléeueth his lawes and yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Pope all that authoritie which he claimeth, yet doth he loſe halfe his reuenues, authoritie, and regall ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie.</p>
                  <p>For firſt the Pope ſhareth the Kings reuenues, claiming tenths, firſt fruites, ſubſidies, confirmation and diſpoſition of Eccleſiaſticall liuings, and infinite ſummes of money for pardons, licences, diſpenſations, and all maner of reſcripts. Thoſe which are acquainted with the Popes faculties and incrochments in former Kings dayes within this land,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18556:115"/> and now in <hi>Spaine, Italy,</hi> and other popiſh countries, know they are intelerable, and no way inferior to the Kings reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. Nay, if a King néed a diſpenſation for an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call matter, he is forced to bargaine with the Pope, and to buy it deare. The abſolution of King <hi>Iohn</hi> had like to haue coſt him the Crowne of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, not the King but the Pope is King of prieſts and eccleſiaſticall perſons. <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> in the chap. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricis de immunit. eccleſ. in <hi>6.</hi>
                     </hi> doth excommunicate both Kings and others, that impoſe taxes and ſubſidies vpon the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. He doth alſo lay the ſame cenſure vpon thoſe clergie men, that pay any ſubſidies to ciuill Magiſtrates: which ſheweth, that he kept them for his owne ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the fourth, in the chap. <hi>Quia nonnulli de immunit. eccleſian <hi>6.</hi>
                     </hi> exempteth the poſſeſſions and goods of clergy men from toll and cuſtome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his treatiſe <hi>De exemptione clericorum cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </hi> ſetteth downe theſe propoſitions. <hi>In cauſis Eccleſiaſticis liberi ſunt clerici iure diuino à ſecularium principum poteſtate.</hi> That is, <hi>In Eccleſiaſtical cauſes clerkes are free from the commaund of ſecular princes, by the law of God.</hi> And by eccleſiaſticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth all matters which concerne the church, and which by hooke or crooke the Popes haue drawne to their owne cognition. Againe he ſayth, <hi>Non poſſunt Clerici à Iudice ſeculari iudicari, etiamſi leges ciuiles non ſeruent.</hi> That is, <hi>Clerks are not to be iudged of ſecular Iudges, albeit they keep not his temporall lawes.</hi> His third propoſition is this: <hi>Bona clericorum, tam eccleſiastica, quàm ſecularia libera ſunt, ac meritò eſſe debent, à tributis principum ſecularium.</hi> That is, <hi>The goods of clerkes, whether they belong to the Church, or be temporal, are free from tributes of princes, and ſo ought to be.</hi> He ſayth alſo, <hi>that ſecular princes, in reſpect of clerkes, are not ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne princes, and that therefore clerkes are not bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them.</hi> Now how is the King abſolute in his kingdome, if he haue neither power ouer the perſons of the clerks, nor their goods?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> in his aphoriſmes, <hi>In verbo, Clericus:</hi> in his book
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18556:116"/> firſt printed, and alleaged by him that wrote the <hi>Franc diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>Clerici rebellio in regem, non eſt crimen laeſae maieſtatis, quia non eſt ſubditus regi. <hi>The rebellion of a clerk againſt the King, is no treaſon, becauſe he is not the kings ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</hi>
                     </hi> This is plaine dealing, and ſheweth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king is no king of the Clergie, where the Popes lawes beare ſway. But becauſe theſe words be ſomewhat too plaine, therefore in a later edition of theſe aphoriſmes ſet out at <hi>Venice,</hi> they haue for their owne eaſe cut out the words, albeit in effect <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others teach ſo much.</p>
                  <p>Their practiſe alſo declareth that this is their meaning: for <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> ſtoutly reſiſted <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond,<note place="margin">Mat Pariſ. in Hen. 2.</note> and his parliament enacting, <hi>that clerkes offending againſt the kings lawes, ſhould anſwer before the kings Iuſtices.</hi> Further, he would not agree that clerkes lay-fée ſhould come in trial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixtus quartus</hi> did enterdite the ſtate of <hi>Florence,</hi> for that they had executed the Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa</hi> notoriouſly taken in a conſpiracie againſt the State. <hi>Xiſtus, quòd ſacrato viro, &amp; Archiepiſcopo ita foede interfecto Cardinalem quoque cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuum feciſſent, Hieronymo inſtigante grauiſſimum Florentinis (ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris omnibus interdictis) bellu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> intulit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Onuphrius:</hi> That is, <hi>Sixtus warred vpon the Florentines, and enterdited them for that they had killed the Archbiſhop of Piſa being a prieſt, and layd hands on a cardinall.</hi> And yet he declareth they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in the conſpiracie againſt <hi>Iulian</hi> and <hi>Laurence de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi> that then ruled the State.</p>
                  <p>This was alſo the greateſt quarrell of the Pope againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> for that he cauſed the Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to be killed, being culpable of moſt enormous trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt him. Now what can Kings do againſt their ſubiects, if they may not puniſh them offending in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Popes do draw many temporall matters from the cognition of the King, to themſelues and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8. <hi>c. quoniam. de Immunitat. Eccleſ. in</hi> 6.</hi> doth excommunicate all thoſe <hi>that do hinder matters to be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18556:116"/> brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> triall of temporall iudges to Eccleſiaſticall courts,</hi> and namely thoſe, <hi>that will not ſuffer all contracts, confirmed by oathes, to be tried before Eccleſiaſticall iudges.</hi> By which meanes almoſt all cauſes were brought before them, and the Kings iuriſdiction almoſt ſtopped and ſuſpended. The Kings of <hi>England</hi> therfore, to reſtraine theſe incrochme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, made the law of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> putting them out of his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that wold not be tried by his lawes. Is it not ſtrange then, that Chriſtian princes ſhould ſuffer ſuch companions to vſurpe their authoritie, and not onely in cauſes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, but alſo in temporall to beare them ſelues as iudges.</p>
                  <p>Finally they deny, that Chriſtian Princes haue power either to make Eccleſiaſticall lawes, or to reforme abuſes in the Church, or to gouerne the Church concerning exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall matters. All papiſts do ſo diſtinguiſh betwixt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical and politicke gouernement, that they exclude tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes from the gouernement of the Church, and make them ſubiect to the Pope. <hi>Bellarmine <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Pontif. Rom. c.</hi> 7.</hi> determineth, that <hi>temporall Princes are no gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If then Chriſtian Princes looſe part of their reuenues, and part of their iuriſdiction, and are quite excluded, both from the gouernement of the Church, and alſo diſpoſing of the perſons and goods of Eccleſiaſticall perſons; moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent it is, that ſuch Princes as admit the Popes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are either but halfe kings, or elſe not ſo much, looſing more then halfe their authoritie, by the Popes incroch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>How contrarie this is to the doctrine of the Apoſtles and ancient fathers, we néede not here diſpute. <hi>S.

                     </hi> ſheweth, that the Apoſtles wordes <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> concerne clerkes and religious men, as well as lay men.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is alſo contrarie to the practiſe of the Church vnder the Law, and vnder the Goſpell, and derogatorie to the Kings authoritie. For both vnder the Law, and when Emperors began to profeſſe Chriſtian religion, they made lawes for the Church, and reformed Eccleſiaſticall abuſes, as both Scriptures, and the lawes of the <hi>Code</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelles</hi> teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> this authoritie is plainly vſurped by the Pope and his followers. For vntill <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth his time, who by force and armes preuailed more, then by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; we find, that the clergie and Church was gouerned by Chriſtian princes, and their lawes.</p>
                  <p>Finally the ſame is diſgracefull to Kings, and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to ſubiects, and moſt vnreaſonable. Diſgracefull it is to Kings to looſe their royalties, and to be made ſubiect to forreiners. Burdenſome it is to good ſubiects, vpon whom the whole burden is laid, and they exempted which are beſt able to beare. The <hi>Germaines</hi> in their grieuances, <hi>Grauam, 28.</hi> ſhew, <hi>that the charge of the warre againſt the Turke is laid wholy on lay-mens ſhoulders.</hi> Finally, it is no reaſon, that thoſe ſhould liue vnder the Kings protection, that neither pay him tribute, nor acknowledge his authoritie.</p>
                  <p>But of the vnreaſonableneſſe of theſe incrochments we ſhall haue occaſion to diſpute elſwhere. Here it is ſufficient to ſhew, that the Popes vſurpations, exactions and whole
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18556:117"/> authoritie is preiudiciall to Kings, &amp; vntollerable to their ſubiectes.</p>
                  <p>Be wiſe therefore O ye Kings of the earth, and ſerue <hi>Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> but beware that in ſtead of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ye ſerue not Antichriſt. And you that are fréed by the preaching of the Goſpell from the bondage of the Popes traditions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, take héed that you ſuffer not your ſelues to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled againe in his ſnares, &amp; brought againe into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. The Popes agents tell you of many goodly actions of the Pope, and ſet out the beautie of traditions with faire words. But they ſéeke nothing, but to bring you into a ſnare, and to make merchandiſe of your ſoules, and to blind you ſo, that you ſhall not be able to ſée the miſerie of thoſe, that liue vnder him, or the traſh of his falſe doctrine and traditions. God graunt you therfore the ſpirit of wiſedome and diſcretion, that you may ſtand faſt in the liberty of true Chriſtians, and neuer be entangled againe with the yoke of Popiſh bondage.</p>

                  <p>The man was borne in an obſcure village in Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire: his putatiue father was called <hi>Cowbucke,</hi> a poore Blackſmith, of the race, or at leaſt qualitie of <hi>Vulcan:</hi> for he was matched to <hi>Parſons</hi> his mother,<note place="margin">Her husband tooke a filthy diſeaſe of her, of which the poore man died.

This decowled Monk made the mariage betwixt <hi>Cowbucke</hi> the ſmith and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Parſons</hi> his mother.<note place="margin">Plautus in Caſina.</note> So <hi>Stalino</hi> would haue placed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina</hi> with his hind <hi>Olympio, <hi>Sperans ſibi paratas fore clam vx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore excubias foras:</hi>
                     </hi> That is, <hi>hoping without his wiues priuitie to keepe watch abrode.</hi> And <hi>Holt</hi> the Iebuſite would haue maried his wench or concubine to one <hi>Thomas Edwards</hi> (a man, and matter not vnknowne to <hi>Parſons</hi>). It may be he will ſay, this is from the purpoſe: yet can he not deny, but that it is good to illuſtrate matters by examples.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> is not vnlike the Monke, <hi>Tum
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18556:119"/> quòd malè audit,</hi> that is, both becauſe he heareth euill of one ſide eſpecially, and becauſe he hath not both his eares on one ſide. The lineaments of his face alſo do bewray him to be of kinred to <hi>Haywood.</hi> Finally, his deſire to be a monkiſh Iebuſite, and a prieſt, doth argue that he was a prieſts or Monks ſonne: and his gibing and ieſting, that he was <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> ſon, who was in his time a mad ieaſting knaue. For as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pro Rabir. poſthumo.</note> 
                     <hi>ſonnes do follow lightly the example of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> as he proueth by the examples of <hi>Scipio</hi> and the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Decius.</hi> Neither is it materiall that theſe men were not baſtards, ſeeing baſtardie doth not alter the caſe.</p>
                  <p>Certes if <hi>Haywood</hi> was not his father, then was he much deceiued, kéeping <hi>Parſons</hi> at ſchoole, and bringing him vp as his ſonne. Then was alſo <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> much abuſed, that would not be called by the beaſtly name of <hi>Cowbucke</hi> that had his name of two horned beaſts, but of the prieſtly title of his true father: and being charged with baſtardie in <hi>Bayliol</hi> colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi> durſt neuer ſtand to it, but as guiltie of that matter departed the colledge, for feare he ſhould haue bene thruſt out headlong. The matter certes was much ſuſpected, this <hi>Heywood</hi> lying in the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths houſe, and ſupplying the mans place, and being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally defamed for this matter.</p>
                  <p>Finally, if he wil not beléeue me, let him heare his owne conſorts y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecular prieſts depoſe againſt him. <hi>Parſons</hi> (ſayth the author of the diſcouery of Engliſh Ieſuites) <hi>is by birth a baſtard, begotten of the body of a baſe woman, by the parſon of the pariſh where he was borne, and his right name is not Parſons, but Cowbucke.</hi> Againe: <hi>the ſame parſon that begot him, did afterwards foſter him, and hauing brought him vp at the ſchoole, ſent him to Oxford, and placed him in Bayliol colledge, whence he was expelled being maſter of Arts, not for religion, as he hath vaunted, but for his baſtardie, factious conuerſation, libelling, and other miſdemeanors.</hi> This note of baſtardie is alſo put vpon him in a certaine declaration of the prieſts made to the Pope, and was not forgotten either by him that wrote the reply to <hi>Parſons</hi> libell fol. <hi>91.</hi> or by
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:18556:120"/> the Quodlibetiſt, <hi>Quodl. 4. art. 2. p. 109. We may not imagine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that father <hi>Parſons</hi> was ignorant of his owne eſtate, as being a ſacrilegious baſtard in the worſe ſenſe, <hi>ſcilicet a Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> begotten by the parſon of the pariſh where he was borne, vpon the bodie of a very baſe queane.</hi> This is the teſtimony of <hi>Watſon,</hi> a popiſh martyr: and I hope <hi>Parſons</hi> wil not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a martyrs teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>If then, <hi>Spuria vitulamina non dabunt radices altas, nec ſtabile firmamentum collocabunt:</hi> that is, <hi>if baſtard ſlips ſhall not take deepe roote, nor ſtand on a firme foundation,</hi> then is it not like, that this caluiſh vitulamen, or baſtard, the ſon or calfe of goodwife <hi>Cowbucke,</hi> can take déepe roote. Inſomuch as many wonder that this baſtard ſlip is not grafted vpon <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> ſtocke, and long ſince withered like an elderne ſticke without pith.</p>
                  <p>While he was yong, the fellow was much noted for his ſingular impudency and diſorder in apparel, going in great barrell hoſe, as was the faſhion of hackſters in thoſe times, &amp; drawing alſo déepe in a barrell of ale. Heare I pray you, what <hi>A.C.</hi> the author of the Maſſe prieſts late ſupplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſayth of him in his third letter. <hi>He was</hi> (ſaith <hi>A.C.) <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon alehouſe ſquire, and the drunkeneſt ſponge in all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh where he liued.</hi>
                     </hi> His mother could kéepe no good liquor for him: ſuch a dangerous enemie was he to the aletap. The ſame <hi>A.C.</hi> chargeth him <hi>with begetting two baſtards male and female vpon the body of his owne ſiſter betweene the age of ſeuenteene and 23:</hi> and this ſaith he, <hi>was the cauſe why he ranne away, and became a Ieſuit.</hi> O famous vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Iebuſit, or rather filthy inceſtuous Cananite! O braue patron of Romiſh or rather rammiſh virginitie!</p>
                  <p>Of nature he was malicious, and from his youth giuen to ſpeake euill, and to write libels. One libell he wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>D. Squire,</hi> wherein he touched a certain Ladie, which had like to haue turned him to much trouble. Since he ran out of his country, the writing of infamous libels againſt his dread Soueraigne, and other principall gouernors of the State, hath bene his principall ſtudie, as the libell
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18556:120"/> againſt maſter <hi>Charke,</hi> the libell againſt my <hi>Lord of Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> commonly called <hi>Greenecote,</hi> the libell againſt the Queene, ſet out vnder the titles of <hi>Cardinall Allen, Didimus Veridicus,</hi> and <hi>Andreas Philopater,</hi> againſt my Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer lately deceaſed, againſt the whole ſtate intituled <hi>de Schiſmate Anglicano,</hi> and diuers others, which either hée wrote, or publiſhed, or holpe to write or publiſh, doe plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>If then the authors of famous libels be infamous; why is not <hi>Parſons</hi> puniſhed for an infamous libeller? If ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards be irregular, why is he made a Ieſuite and a prieſt? Are ſuch baſtardly and infamous <hi>Parſons</hi> fit perſons to be made prieſts? and is this the perfection of the Iebuſiticall order, which they brag off?</p>
                  <p>While he continued in Bailiol colledge,<note place="margin">Bagſhaw in his Apologie.</note> 
                     <hi>one Stancliffe his fellow burſer did charge him with forgery:</hi> Beſide that diuers other articles were put vp againſt him, and <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nine or thirtie came before the maſter and fellowes,</hi> as <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> ſaith, <hi>to demaund iuſtice againſt him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſtopher Bagſhaw</hi> his fellow prieſt teſtifieth, <hi>that being burſer, he disfurniſhed the colledge library of many auncient bookes, and rare manuſcripts.</hi> A true man he is, as it ſeemeth, being conuinced both of forgery, filchery, and periury: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſworne to be true, a true thiefe to the colledge. For theſe and other miſdemeanors, <hi>he had the fauour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne being firſt lawfully expelled,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> in his apologie againſt <hi>Parſons</hi> ſlanders, and with ſuch fauour he departed, that no man ſeemed deſirous he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the colledge any longer. I thinke he may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he was rung with belles out of the houſe, which was either a ſigne of triumph, or elſe of his diſmall depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the world. At the ſame time, <hi>he made a ſubmiſſion with many teares,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> and promiſed, that he would euer after carry himſelfe in a good ſort: but if he forgot his oth made firſt, it was no maruell, if he forgot his promiſe made after.</p>
                  <p>Hauing receiued this diſgrace, not long after he fled like
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18556:121"/> a fugitiue out of his countrey, and became a <hi>Iebuſite.</hi> For note, that periured fugitiues, make prime Iebuſites. So, that was verified in him, that is commonly found true in others, <hi>Quod deſperatio facit monachum.</hi> For deſperatly hee caſt himſelfe away into a monkiſh order, although not long before he had deepely proteſted, that he would neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a papiſt.</p>
                  <p>What religion was in him, it may appeare, for that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly he tooke on him a religion, which he had a litle before forſworne. Beſide that, being in <hi>England</hi> he alwaies profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame religion that we doe, and in priuate commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with his friends, ſeemed deſirous to learne ſome good courſe of ſtudy of diuinitie. Being burſer, hee bought many bookes written by learned men of our ſide, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in the library of <hi>Bailioll</hi> colledge in <hi>Oxford.</hi> What is then to be collected of all his demeanour and actions, but that diſgrace and malice, and no other reaſon made him a papiſt, a friar, and an apoſtata?</p>
                  <p>Departing out of the countrey, hee went not away empty handed. For he carried away diuers ſummes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which he had receiued of his ſchollers friends, without rendring accompt. Promiſing alſo to make a match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one of his ſchollers and a gentlewoman his mothers neighbour, he tooke money of both the parties friends, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit neither of the parties knew any ſuch matter, nor their friends had talked together. A very prety tricke to be plaid for his firſt prize of coſinage. The ſeculer prieſts charge him with miſpending the almes that is beſtowed on the engliſh Seminaries, vpon his intelligencers, &amp; ſpies, in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage, and vpon his priuat pleaſures. After his departure out of <hi>England,</hi> the man coſined the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> the Spaniſh king, and others, offering like a montebanke, the crowne of <hi>England</hi> to ſale to any that would buy it. A thing certes of good price, if he could haue made his ſale good.</p>
                  <p>He may remember, that <hi>Marforio</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> touched him in a certaine ticket for this groſſe coſinage. But great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18556:121"/> it is, that the Pope hath not truſſed him ere this, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all his promiſes of intelligences, treaſons and packes in <hi>England,</hi> to be nothing elſe but méere coſinage, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery, and knauery, to procure himſelfe to be made <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this, both himſelfe, and his brother and friends did ſo greedily looke for, that on a time being aduiſed to weare a péece of ſcarlet before his ſtomacke, and giuing order, that a péece might be brought from the marchant, his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe brother thinking the time of his aduancement had bene come, cauſed as much ſcarlet to be brought to him as would make him a Cardinals robes. But with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and bluſhing, like as if his face had bene died ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, <hi>Parſons</hi> conueyed the man and his ſcarlet out by a poſterne gate. But the ſcorne and blemiſh ſtill ſtucke to him.</p>
                  <p>Of his vertuous life in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in the colledge at <hi>Rome,</hi> we neede not to ſtand much, ſeeing the markes of his honeſty appeare in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puſtules of his face, but eſpecially in his ſcabbed legs. The which myſteries of Iebuſites, leaſt they ſhould be reuealed, they haue a graunt of the Pope to haue Phyſitions of their owne company.

His impudency in lying, and great cunning in iugling, may be conuinced by his bold aſſertions and denials againſt all truth, and by his ſhifting and cogging in all his writings: which giue plaine euidence, that the man when he fled from his countrey, left honeſty, ſhame, and conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, if euer he had any, as by diuers arguments in the treatiſe enſuing ſhall, godwilling, be verified.

                  <p>Of his cruell diſpoſition,<note place="margin">Bagſhaw his apologie.</note> he hath giuen vs many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. While he was yet in <hi>Bailioll</hi> colledge he proſecuted ſeuen young men of farre better parentage then himſelfe, and gladly would haue had them hanged for taking cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine puddings from a pupill of his called <hi>Himmes.</hi> He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to draw <hi>Himmes</hi> his father into bond, that hée ſhould not ceaſe to proſecute the fellonie, and would haue proceeded further, had not the councell taken order to ſtay his violence: it may be he thought, that taking of puddings was a great matter, conſidering eſpecially, that the wealth of the tripewife his mother conſiſted in tripes, puddings, and ſouce: but ſée Gods hand againſt this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of takers of puddings, he is now ſo ſwollen like a blacke pudding, that the memory of <hi>Parſons</hi> puddings will not lightly be forgotten.

                     <hi>William Browne <hi>aliâs</hi> Ch.

Finally the mans traitorous practiſes againſt the Quéene and his countrey, in many volumes cannot ſufficiently be deſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phred. His firſt comming into <hi>England</hi> was to make a ſide, and to moue rebellion. And that is prooued by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties graunted <hi>anno <hi>1580.</hi> Petatur</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>à S. domine noſtro, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Let it be deſired of our moſt holy Lord the Pope, that the bull declaratorie of Pius the fift againſt Elizabeth and her adherents, be vnderſtood in this manner, that the ſame bull ſhall alwayes bind her and all heretikes,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18556:123"/> but not (Romiſh) Catholikes, as matters doe now ſtand, but onely then, when the bull may publikely be put in execution.</hi> By this facultie being granted, then it appeareth, that the bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> was in force againſt the Quéene and her ſubiects, and that <hi>Parſons</hi> came to ſtirre vp falſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, or rather falſe traitors, to put it in execution, as ſoone as occaſion ſhould be offered. Now according to the tenor of his faculties, the fellow ceaſed not to rake in the coles of mens diſcontented humours, and to make a partie againſt the Queene. The papiſts ſaw he dealt ſo openly, that they feared, leaſt if the fire tooke, a number of them ſhould be burned in the flames. Such was the feare of the wiſeſt of them, that they told him plainely, that if he retired not himſelfe, they would diſcouer him to her Maieſties officers.</p>
                  <p>Being thus forced more then halfe againſt his will to depart out of <hi>England,</hi> yet ceaſed he not to procure vs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles from <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the king now raigning can tell, and his libell againſt the Earle of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> that ſeemeth to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the kings title, doth manifeſtly proue. Nay in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Earle of <hi>Angus</hi> he doth plainely confeſſe, that at that time he was for the kings title, and ſought preſently to ſet it on foote, without longer ſtaying for the Queenes death.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>France</hi> he encouraged the <hi>D. of Guiſe</hi> to come with an army into <hi>England,</hi> not forgetting in the meane while to aduance the treaſon of <hi>Parry</hi> &amp; <hi>Sauage.</hi> There alſo he was acquainted, by the meanes of <hi>Ballard,</hi> with <hi>Babingtons</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie. Neither is it to be doubted, but he knew of friar <hi>Sammiers</hi> comming to the kings mother, of which enſued the ruine of her, as the authour of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> Catechiſme teſtifieth. It is ſaid alſo, that he cauſed <hi>500.</hi> crownes to be deliuered to <hi>Ch. Paget</hi> to come ouer into <hi>England</hi> to treat with the Earle of <hi>N.</hi> whereof his deſtruction enſued not long after.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Flanders</hi> he ſought alſo to draw the <hi>D. of Parma</hi> into quarrell with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> offering him the Lady
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18556:124"/> 
                     <hi>Arbella,</hi> and the crowne of <hi>England</hi> for his ſonne. But he was no more able to performe his offer then the deuill, that promiſed to giue all the kingdomes of the earth to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> That packe being broken, he ſolicited the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> againſt <hi>England <hi>anno</hi> 1588.</hi> ayding <hi>Card. Allen</hi> to make that moſt execrable libell, which he titleth <hi>an exhortation to the Nobility and people of England and Ireland,</hi> which containeth all the diſgrace that could be deuiſed, both againſt the Quéene, &amp; her ſubiects. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he did in deuiſing of that traitorous libell, one <hi>W. Br. <hi>aliâs</hi> Pag.</hi> chargeth him, that hee holpe to print it, and gaue diuers copies to his friends.</p>
                  <p>Departing out of the low countries, he committed the managing of matters to one <hi>Holt,</hi> a man of his owne ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and confrairy of traytours. If then <hi>Holt</hi> was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the practiſes of <hi>Yorke, Williams,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> for killing the Quéene, as he is charged by <hi>W. Br. <hi>aliâs</hi> Ch. Pag.</hi> or with <hi>Heskets</hi> trecherous agency with the Earle of Darby; then no doubt, but <hi>R. Parſons</hi> was made priuie therewith alſo, ſeeing he was but as an inferiour ſphere concurring with <hi>Parſons,</hi> that like <hi>primum mobile</hi> drew with him all inferior traytors, and made all matters of treaſon to be taken in hand.</p>
                  <p>Reſiding in <hi>Spaine,</hi> his onely purpoſe was, to ſet this land in combuſtion. To worke a deteſtation of her Maieſtie, and of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation in the mindes of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he cauſed a moſt ſlanderous libell ſet forth before in Latin, to be tranſlated into <hi>Spaniſh</hi> by one <hi>Ribadineira</hi> a man of his owne trayterous order, adding thereunto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſlaunderous and moſt vntrue reports of his owne, auouching his owne lies vpon the credit of Sanders being now dead. And that this is true, not onely his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth witneſſe, but that ribald <hi>Ribadineira</hi> muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, if he be aliue, and will teſtifie truth. For to draw the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> into the party, he ſet out a moſt fond booke of titles to the crowne of <hi>England,</hi> caſting the ſame with all the force of his wit vpon the <hi>Infanta of Spaine,</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:18556:124"/> ſéeking to depriue the right heires, and endeuoring to bring vs vnder the captiuitie of ſtrangers: to which end alſo he cauſed diuers of the Engliſh nation reſiding in <hi>Spaine</hi> to ſubſcribe to that title.</p>
                  <p>With the helpe of <hi>Creſwell</hi> and others his adherents, he cauſed diuers trecherous inuectiues to be publiſhed againſt her Maieſty &amp; the State; and that partly vnder the names of <hi>Andreas Philopater, Didimus Veridicus,</hi> and ſuch like counterfet names, and partly without names.</p>
                  <p>By his, and other his traitorous conſorts ſolicitation, King <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond ſent forth a fléet to ſea: of which, two attempts followed: the one about the yeare <hi>1598.</hi> in which diuers ſhips by ſtreſſe of wether were wracked on the coaſt of <hi>Spaine,</hi> betwixt the Rocke and <hi>Cap. finis terrae:</hi> the ſecond followed not long after. The firſt is proued by <hi>D. Stillingto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and other Maſſeprieſts, perſwaded by <hi>Parſons</hi> to come with publike enemies againſt <hi>England:</hi> the ſecond is mentioned in a letter of the ſaid <hi>Parſons</hi> to <hi>Th.

And ſo earneſt was the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> in ſetting forth this fleete againſt <hi>England,</hi> that at one time, returning to himſelfe out of a trance, the firſt words he ſpoke, were, <hi>Whether is the Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantado gone for England?</hi> At another time, being at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions, he ſaid, He would ſpend the furniture of his chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but he would be reuenged vpon the Engliſh. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prieſts in their reply to <hi>Parſons</hi> libell, fol. <hi>65.</hi> do alſo mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe preparations. Neither is it to be doubted, but that <hi>Parſons</hi> concurred in the ſolicitation of them. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Reply</hi> ſpeaking of theſe preparations for <hi>England: Theſe two preparations</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>are ſo euident, to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with his concurrence and cooperation, as he no way can deny it without the note of impudency, ſo many witneſſes, and his owne letters bring in teſtimonie againſt him.</hi> He doth likewiſe affirme, <hi>that the vrging of diuers to ſubſcribe to the Infantaes title, is a matter notorious and euident, and to be proued by the othes of diuers prieſts.</hi> In his letters to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18556:125"/> Earle of <hi>Scotland, Parſons</hi> plainely confeſſeth diuers practiſes ſet on foote by himſelfe againſt <hi>England,</hi> and that he ſought to aduance the Spaniſh <hi>Infantaes</hi> title, as being of his religion.</p>
                  <p>The reſolutions of caſes of conſcience, ſet out by <hi>A. P.</hi> that is, <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Parſons,</hi> for direction of their traitorous ſchollers, are nothing elſe but reſolutions to proue them both traitors, and enemies to their countrie, declaring the Queene <hi>to be a tyrant, and no lawfull Queene, and her officers no lawfull officers,</hi> and ayming wholly at the ouerthrow of the State.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it is auerred by the ſecular prieſts, that <hi>Parſons</hi> had a finger in the rebellions of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Neither is it to be doubted, but that he &amp; his agent <hi>Creſwel</hi> were acquainted with the enterpriſe of <hi>D. Iuan d'Aquila</hi> in <hi>Kinſale,</hi> many traitorous Engliſh being that time in companie with the Spaniards.</p>
                  <p>If then this be one of the chiefe pillars of Romiſh faith, certaine it is, that the Romiſh faith ſtandeth vpon diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and trechery, or at leaſt vpon a wicked diſloyall traitor. If Papiſts wold conſider theſe his practiſes, they wold not ſo much eſtéeme his <hi>directories, libels, diſcoueries, inuectiues, wardwords,</hi> or rather a wardrobe of knauery and villanie, his <hi>Warnewords,</hi> &amp; ſuch like odious fardles of idle words, which rather direct men to the gallowes, then to religion and vertue: which ſhall further appeare in the anſwer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. This in the meane while I thought to relate, for eaſe of his holy father, if percaſe he liſt to ſaint this horſe-holy Frier. And if in the meane while he be not created Cardinall, by reaſon of his infamous baſtardie, and foule vellaquerie, &amp; too open playing aboue boord: yet let him be a Cardinall, and a card excarnificable, veſted with Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals robes of yellow, blew, and gréene, like the Knaue of Clubbes.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the title Warne-word, and other matters promiſed and prefixed in the front of Parſons his booke.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> Gooſe (they ſay) may be knowne by a feather. If men will not beléeue me, yet may it be verified by the gooſe <hi>Parſons.</hi> For by his moſt fooliſh title, being the firſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his gooſeſhips worke, we may aſſure our ſelues we ſhall haue a great péece of foolerie. For albeit he promiſe vs but one Warneword, yet hath he ſent vs a whole fardle of idle words and fantaſticall fooleries.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as admonitions and warnings are ſent to friends, and not to enemies; ſo might he haue done well to haue giuen ſome admonitions to the bougerly boyes of the Engliſh ſeminaries, that ſuffer themſelues to be abuſed too ſhamefully by the bougeronicall Maſſe prieſts, to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of their nation; and not to vs, that regard not witleſſe admonitions a ſtraw.<note place="margin">Eurip. in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea.</note> The tragicall poet might haue told this comicall admonitor, if he had but had any one graine of wit, <hi>that a wicked mans offers and gifts are vnprofitable.</hi> The Gréeke is, <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. But the aſſe vnderſtandeth no Gréek, and not much Latin, being onely acquainted with the iron tongue of his mother the blackſmiths wife.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his whole labour being ſpent in iangling and bangling about ſome pild matters of his popiſh paltry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; he muſt ſhew how all that naſtie geare will come within the compaſſe of his title, vnleſſe he will haue the ſame throwne out among the waſte of his idle inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, his running vpon the letter in the titles of his <hi>Warneword, Wardword, Waſtword,</hi> and in his mentioning of <hi>Watchword</hi> doth ſhew, that there is more rime then reaſon in his booke, and doth preſage, that we ſhould rather
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18556:126"/> haue ratling words, then ſound reaſon. He ſayth, that the <hi>VVarneword containeth the iſſue of three treatiſes.</hi> And yet he onely handleth two chapters of eight, beſide other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, ſeldome daring to giue the true iſſue, taking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Papiſts for Catholickes, and popery for truth: which is denied. Is it then like that he meaneth truth, that falſifieth his word ſo groſſely in the firſt words of his booke?</p>
                  <p>After that he talketh of a reiection <hi>of an inſolent and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting miniſter, maſked with the letters O. E.</hi> and of certaine ſhifts and deceits, as he pretendeth of ours. But herein his friends complaine, that his eyes were either out or not at home. For if he had looked vpon himſelfe, that commeth forth maſked with <hi>N.D.</hi> which letters with the helpe of <hi>O. E.</hi> come neare Noddey: he would not haue found fault with me for the ſame matter. Howbeit to prouoke him to ſhew his baſtardly face, I haue bene content to leaue all the foure letters to him alone, and plainly to ſet downe my name, promiſing that I will take him to taſke, in what forme ſoeuer he turneth himſelfe into, if it be not into the ſhape of a clew of packthréed, which is endleſſe, and of no good gouſt. In the meane while, if he had not bene the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Satan, he would not haue made a ieſt at the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the word of God, which is an office not refuſed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles, nor by holy fathers of the Church, nor by any, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> idolatrous prieſts of <hi>Baal.</hi> As for the termes of <hi>inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy and vanting, of ſhifting and deceiuing,</hi> I doubt not but to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten them ſo iuſtly vpon <hi>Parſons,</hi> and that by due proofe, that all the world may ſee the vanity and inſolency of this decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Now I will onely tell him, that it becommeth not him to obiect <hi>inſolencie, vanting, ſhifting and deceit</hi> to any other. For nothing is more abſurd then that ſuch a buzzard as he, ſhould impute to others his owne buzzardly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>For the poſie of his booke, he taketh a ſentence that fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe wondrous well: neither will we deny that it belongeth to him.<note place="margin">Titus 3.</note>

For why ſhould I helpe him, that pronounceth ſentence againſt himſelfe, by his owne iudgement, while he remained among vs? And now no doubt but in his owne conſcience he is condemned, knowing that it is idolatry to giue diuine honour to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords body, and to the images of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hereſie to hold, that a man can liue without al ſinne, or at the leaſt to fulfill the law perfectly.

For if the Pope and his generall giue him licence to publiſh libels and ſlaunders againſt vs; we will be bold to anſwer his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and to touch his ſuperiours to their litle fatiſfaction, and to the great griefe of <hi>Parſons.</hi>

                  <p>AGainſt all our aduerſaries accuſations, beſide particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar defences, we haue theſe generall exceptions for the moſt part: firſt we ſay, of matters criminall that we are cleare.

                     <note place="margin">In the Epiſtle to the Reader</note>To come to particulars, this admonitor doth charge <hi>ſir Francis Haſtings, for that without commiſſion he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a generall watch-man ouer all the land, and hath written a moſt bitter and bloudie pamphlet againſt the Catholickes,</hi> (as he ſayth) <hi>repleniſhed with all kind of ſlaunders, and moſt odious calumniations.</hi> Likewiſe in his obſeruations vpon the preface of my reply to his <hi>Wardword,</hi> fol. <hi>11.</hi> b. he ſayth, <hi>my preface tendeth wholy to bloodſhed and crueltie againſt Catholikes:</hi> and ſticketh not of his liberalitie to cal me <hi>a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious firebra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But if he charge no better, we ſhal eaſily diſcharge our ſelues, and lay ſuch a charge vpon him, that his owne friends ſhall confeſſe him to be a notorious ſot, &amp; a leud accuſer, to deale on this faſhion. For firſt, what reaſon had he to aſke a commiſſion in this caſe, ſéeing euery one hath not onely a commiſſion, but is alſo bound by dutie and allegeance to maintaine the State, &amp; to do his prince and countrey ſeruice? <hi>In reos maieſtatis &amp; publicos hoſtes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian) <hi>omnis homo miles eſt:</hi>
                     </hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apolog. c. 2.</note> that is, <hi>Euery one is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed a ſouldier againſt traitors and publike enemies.</hi> Could <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> more manifeſtly declare himſelfe enemie, then by bauling againſt thoſe that ſpeake againſt traitors and publicke enemies? Secondly, why may not a Knight
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18556:127"/> ſpeake for his prince and country, when he like a traitorous knaue without commiſſion or allowance taketh to himſelfe liberty to ſpeake for notorious traitors &amp; publike enemies? Thirdly, it is a matter ridiculous for an enemy to accuſe men of bitterneſſe and bloody cruelty, of ſlanderous accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſedition, and yet to bring neither proofe nor ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition to conuince them. This therefore is rather a tricke of a ſcurrilous rayler, then a graue accuſer: and ſuch termes <hi>Tully</hi> in his oration <hi>pro Caelio,</hi> calleth rather <hi>railing and ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> then <hi>accuſing.</hi> Fourthly he ſheweth himſelfe an abſurd fellow, to talke either <hi>of bitter and bloodie pamphlets,</hi> or of <hi>odious calumniations,</hi> or of <hi>bloodſhed and crueltie,</hi> or of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes,</hi> when as himſelfe is a ſenſleſſe hereticke, and an apoſtate from religion, and hath ſpent now this twentie yéeres and vpward in rayling and libelling, in laying plots of treaſons, in ſoliciting inuaſions, and ſuch like practiſes: ſéeking nothing elſe but to cut the throtes of his countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to bring them into ſubiection vnto the Spaniards and Italians, as before hath bene declared at full. We are therefore to beſéech his knaueſhip, ſéeing he pleadeth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and traitors and heretickes, to giue vs leaue to ſpeake for our countrey, our Soueraigne, our Religion and libertie. Fiftly, Catholikes are they, <hi>which beleeue and hold that which the Catholicke church in old time did vniuerſally hold,</hi> as ſayth <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis de haereſ. c. <hi>34.</hi>
                     </hi> But the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church in old time did neuer vniuerſally hold either the popiſh reall preſence of Chriſts body without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the accidents of bread and wine, or that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents did ſubſiſt without their ſubſtance, or that Chriſts true body was impalpable and inuiſible, and both in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earth at one time, or tranſſubſtantiation, or the popiſh Maſſe, or communion vnder one kind, or the reſt of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſacraments, or popiſh purgatory and indulgences, or ſuch like. Nor did Catholikes euer prefer the Latin tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old and new teſtament before the originall text, or place traditions in equall ranke with Scriptures.<note place="margin">Lib. de vera. relig. cap. 2.</note> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſheweth, <hi>that catholikes and true beleeuers are all
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18556:128"/> one.</hi> But Papiſts are not <hi>Orthodoxi,</hi> nor true beléeuers, as I haue ſhewed in my challenge. Sixthly, when we ſpeake againſt Papiſts, we meane properly the factious adherents to the Pope and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Parſons</hi> his crew of ſeditious archipreſbyterial and diabolical practiſers againſt the ſtate: againſt whom when we diſcourſe, our whole intention is to ſaue, &amp; not to ſpill blood, which they ſeeke to do, and will, if they be not ſpeedily reſtrained. Finally, ſéeing <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> is ſo braue a diſputer, we muſt pray him to bring good arguments, or elſe to lay aſide his great bombaſted Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiticall words of <hi>ſlander and calumniation.</hi> He may do wel alſo, to ſhew vs the difference betwéene <hi>ſlaunder</hi> and <hi>calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation,</hi> which he in great heate hath diſtinguiſhed, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being ſo excellent a practiſer in calumniation, as his publication of <hi>Sanders de ſchiſmate,</hi> and <hi>Philopater</hi> and other libels do proue him to be. It would finally be knowne, why this fellow that neuer knew his true father, and loued ſo well his mother, ſhould be called <hi>Andreas Philopater,</hi> rather then <hi>Andreas Philiometer.</hi> It is a queſtion alſo why he ſhould be called <hi>Andreas,</hi> rather then <hi>Robertus Philopater.</hi> But percaſe on his toombe he will haue this grauen: <hi>Hic iacet Andreas, qui lapidauit eas. Pro Andreas Philopater, dic A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue Maria</hi> and <hi>Pater noſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Speaking of ſir <hi>Francis Haſtings</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he would gladly faſten vpon him a ſuſpicion, <hi>as if he deſired ſome diuidend of the liuings of Papiſts.</hi> And againe, <hi>1. <hi>encont. c.</hi> 11.</hi> he chargeth him and other knights with dayly féeding vpon papiſticall fellows goods. In his obſeruations vpon my preface, fol. <hi>11.</hi> b. he ſayth, <hi>I watch for ſcraps:</hi> and <hi>that I and my hungrie crew ſtand by, and for deſire licke our lips, hoping to haue ſome ſhare in the deuidend.</hi> Drawing metaphors from his owne, and his hungry companions practiſe, who couching like dogs at the Popes feete, are ſtill looking for ſcraps and bare bones, &amp; gaping for diuidends: and to ſatiſfie their extreme néed, ſometime like curres run grinning vp and downe the ſtréetes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and cannot be ſatiſfied. Others fall together by the eares for biſhoprickes
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18556:128"/> and promotions in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> which they hope will be conquered daily. But their ambitious deſire is like a hungry mans dreame, that thinketh he eateth, and yet ariſeth in the morning ſore a hungred. In his table he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that <hi>I am poore &amp; needy,</hi> but if he had not bene a poore and needy pamphleter, he would haue bene more wary, then thus deſperatly to lie vpon the credit of his intelligencer. For it is well knowne, that <hi>Sir Fr. Haſtings</hi> liueth in hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reputation without deſire of any mans goods. I, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I had no preferment of the Church, yet could I liue of my patrimony. Neither of vs, nor any knight profeſſing the Goſpell, doth liue in ſuch eſtate, that he being a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Friar by his profeſſion, and by birth a poore blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmithes wiues ſonne, may well obiect either néede, or grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſcraping for other mens goods vnto vs. Nay we are ſo farre from deſiring the goods of papiſts, that we wiſh them, as <hi>Saint Auguſtine epiſt. 50.</hi> did the <hi>Donatiſts, that they were Catholikes and honeſt men, and ſo we would not onely leaue them that is theirs, but giue them alſo part of that is ours.</hi> With vs they deale as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did with <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> and we anſwere <hi>Parſons</hi> as he did them. <hi>Quòd nobis obijci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quod res eorum concupiſcamus, &amp; auferamus, vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Catholici fiant, &amp; non ſolùm quae dicunt ſua, ſed etiam noſtra in pace nobiſcum &amp; charitate poſſideant.</hi> If this wiſh content them not, I would wiſh them together with all their goods in <hi>Italie</hi> with their owne holy father. Which if the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and the bloody Inquiſitors would permit to men of our profeſſion, they would accompt it a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. But now ſuch is the crueltie and extremitie of the papiſts, that they torment and put to death all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the truth, and not onely ſhare and deuide, but alſo take all, moſt gréedily without reſpect of their poore widowes, fatherleſſe children, or their poore kinſfolkes. This hauocke the Inquiſitors make in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and this ſpoyle was made by our butcherly enemies in the dayes of <hi>Queene Mary. Parſons</hi> therefore, in putting this vpon vs, did nothing els, but put vs in mind of the rapines of papiſts in Quéene <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:18556:129"/> dayes, and ſhew, what deteſtation we ought to haue of that curſed, rauinous, and woluiſh broode, that dealeth with Chriſtians in this ſort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwere to my Epiſtle fol. 1. b.</note>He findeth alſo fault with my ſtile, as <hi>outragious and intemperate:</hi> and obiecteth <hi>ſcurrilitie and turpitude</hi> vnto me. But if he would haue men to beléeue him, he ſhould haue conuinced me by proofes. For no man, I thinke, that is wiſe will beléeue ſuch a bankerout diſputer on his bare word. Againe he ſhould haue ſhewed good example him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that requireth ſuch reſpectiue termes in others. He is ſtill rayling and raging like a butter wife, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperatly and furiouſly. Hauing therefore declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a ſcurrilous filthy fellow, he ſheweth himſelfe an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent ſot, to obiect his owne faults to others. Of his ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilitie I do meane to make a whole chapter. Of his turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, his baudy and filthie rimes againſt <hi>Beza</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his rayling cenſure againſt maſter <hi>Charke,</hi> yeeld proofe ſufficient.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>Deſcending from his magiſtrall throne of his royall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantery, to ſpeake of my epiſtle, it pleaſeth him to diuide it into three principall parts, to wit: <hi>into notorious folly, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant falſhood, and ridiculous vanitie in bragging and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> But ſeeing he hath diuided no more wiſely, he muſt take the parts all to himſelfe, being a notorious ſot, a falſe packer, and a vaine and ridiculous bragger. Such a one the wiſe man deſcribeth <hi>Prouerb. 6. <hi>Homo apoſtata</hi>
                     </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vir inutilis graditur ore peruerſo, annuit oculis, terit pede, digito loquitur, prauo corde machinatur malum, &amp; omni tempore iurgia ſeminat.</hi> It ſeemeth a proper deſcription of <hi>Parſons</hi> an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate from religion, a man of little worth, that goeth vp and downe with a peruerſe and wide mouth, which win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with his eyes, giueth a ſigne with his feete, ſpeaketh
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18556:129"/> with his fingers, deuiſeth miſchiefe in his wicked heart, and at all times foweth diſcord and contention. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therefore, that he looke for the execution of that which followeth: <hi>Huic exemplo veniet perditio ſua, &amp; ſubitò contere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, nec habebit vltrà medicinam. <hi>This mans deſtruction will come quickly, and he ſhall ſuddenly be broken in peeces, and ſhall find no further remedie.</hi>
                     </hi> As for the folly, falſhood and vanitie he talketh of, they are ſo ſurely faſtened vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he ſhall neuer put them vpon me. To conuince me of folly, he hath alledged the words of <hi>Tully,</hi> that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him <hi>a noddy orator,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>that alledgeth ſuch matter as maketh no leſſe for his aduerſarie, then for himſelfe.</hi> But if this be the part of a noddy, then is <hi>Parſons</hi> a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold noddy, who alledgeth almoſt nothing, but it may with better reaſon be reiected vpon himſelfe, then caſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others: as for example, where he talketh of hereſie, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, bloody pamphlets, folly and ſuch predominant humors and qualities in himſelfe. Againſt me the words of <hi>Tully</hi> make nothing. For albeit I do call him noddy that taketh for his deuiſe <hi>N.D.</hi> which with the addition of two vowels make noddy; yet cannot he by any meanes make noddy out of <hi>O. E.</hi> which letters I aſſume to ſhew his folly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he will lend me his owne name, which I do not meane to borrow at this time. Againe, if he may come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtage with the maſke of <hi>N.D.</hi> why may not he that defendeth, take the two next letters <hi>O. E?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. ff. quod quiſque iuris.</note> The lawes are plaine that no man may refuſe to ſtand to that law, by which himſelfe meaneth to receiue aduantage. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more talking of two letters, where I ſay <hi>he is a man of two or three letters;</hi> he anſwereth but by halfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is like to reſt a noddy, and a man of three letters, that is <hi>Fur,</hi> and the rather for that like a thiefe he came into <hi>England,</hi> entring not by the doore, but ſtealing in ſome other way with picklocke faculties, and treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inſtructions from the Pope. Finally the man ſheweth himſelfe to be, not an orator, but rather a fooliſh grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that calleth conſonants the material part, &amp; vowels the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18556:130"/> formall part of words. For if this were true; then ſhould no word be compounded of vowels, nor ſhould vowels ſtand without conſonants, nor ſhould forme and matter be proper to bodies, but common to words alſo, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Thus we ſée how <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> ſince he ran out of <hi>England</hi> hath outrun both grammer and logike, &amp; is now learning to ſpell <hi>N. D.</hi> It may be if he paſſe Tiburne clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he wil ſhortly enter into his Puerilis, and learne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue <hi>ſtans puer ad menſam,</hi> or percaſe <hi>pendens in patibulo.</hi> To conuince me of <hi>apparant falſhood,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>albeit he might remit himſelfe to a multitude of examples in the encounters enſuing, yet he will ſhew one for a proofe of the miniſters ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in this kind.</hi> But whoſoeuer liſt to compare my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers with his examples, ſhall find that his multitude of examples doth ſhew the multiplicitie of his vanities, and that his whole <hi>Warneword,</hi> is but a fardell of foolery. As for this one example, which he alleadgeth, it may ſerue to iuſtifie my honeſt dealing throughout the whole booke, and to ſhew, that he hath neither wit, nor honeſty. In my reply I charge him, that he hath written diuers odious chartels and bookes, both againſt particular men and the State, and namely, <hi>Firſt certaine chartels againſt ſome in Oxford: Next Leiceſters common-wealth. Thirdly, a libell intitled a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of pretended feares.</hi> Fourthly, the booke ſet out vnder the name of <hi>Andreas Philopater:</hi> Fiftly, the Libell <hi>to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and people of England and Ireland,</hi> ſet out vnder <hi>Card. Allens</hi> name. Sixtly, <hi>Dolmans booke of titles.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly the <hi>Wardword.</hi> Eightly, the <hi>relation of the diſpute betwixt M. Pleſſis and Eureux.</hi> But becauſe I doe not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion other bookes written by him, as for example <hi>Houlets reaſons of refuſal: the Diſcouery of Nicols: the Cenſure againſt Charke: the Epiſtle of perſecution, and his Directory;</hi> he ſaith <hi>that in recounting eight bookes, I tell nine lies, fiue priuatiue, and foure poſitiue.</hi> But in talking of priuatiue lies, hée ſheweth himſelfe not onely a poſitiue, but a ſuperlatiue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard. For if euery one lyed, that reckned not vp all his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try pamphlets; he would bring himſelfe and his owne
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18556:130"/> friendes within the compaſſe of lying. He muſt therefore iuſtifie this fiction of <hi>priuatiue lies,</hi> for elſe he doth nothing. It ſtandeth him alſo vpon, to ſhew that euery one is to take notice of his fooleries, and patcheries. For ſuch is the howling of <hi>Parſons Houlet,</hi> and the <hi>Epiſtle of perſecution,</hi> where he taketh that which is in queſtion for granted. The Cenſure of <hi>Charke,</hi> and <hi>Diſcouery</hi> of <hi>Nicols</hi> do conſiſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of rayling. The Directory is ſtollen out of <hi>Gaſpar Loarti, Granatenſis</hi> &amp; others. He hath no reaſon therefore to brag of ſuch bald inuentions. Where he obiecteth fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood to me, for charging him with certaine libels written againſt ſome in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and with the libell called <hi>Leiceſters</hi> Common-wealth, &amp; the treatiſes entitled <hi>a Confutation of certaine pretended feares, &amp; Letters to the nobilitie and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England and Ireland;</hi> his friends are much aſhamed in his behalfe. For the ſtile and phraſe of theſe bookes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the <hi>Wardword,</hi> and other pamphlets confeſſed to be his, the teſtimony of diuers prieſts in <hi>England,</hi> that ordinarily charge him with theſe bookes, the confeſſions of ſome of his friends, do conuince to lie moſt ſhamefully. Nay his owne conſcience doth accuſe him, and conuict him. For liſten, I pray you, what he anſwereth. <hi>I neuer heard,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>any man of notice and iudgement aſcribe them to him before: and if I be not deceiued, other authors are knowne to haue written them.</hi> Now what is this, but to confeſſe that couertly, that he denyeth coldly? And what traitour or fellon, or ſéely fellow being charged at the barre with noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious treaſons and fellonies cannot anſwere thus, albeit he be charged with things moſt manifeſt? For what trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor cannot ſay, I neuer heard any man of iudgement or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice aſcribe this treaſon vnto me? And againe; If I be not deceiued, others are knowne to haue committed this treaſon. But if <hi>Ro. Parſons</hi> anſwere no better, he will ſoone be conuicted and truſſed for a traitor. In the meane while, he ſhall here onely reſt conuicted of lying and foolery. Of which he may alſo be conuicted, in that taking on him to diſproue me, where I charge him to be the authour of the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18556:131"/> 
                     <hi>Wardword,</hi> he doth afterward plainely confeſſe it. He doth alſo make me to ſay, that <hi>he hath written in all, eight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible treatiſes</hi> (which are no words of mine, but cogged in by him) and chargeth me <hi>with ſuppreſſing his bookes:</hi> where I confeſſe plainely, <hi>that he hath written other baſe and paltry pamphlets.</hi> Whoſoeuer therefore will eſtéeme the reſt of my diſcourſe, by this againſt which he taketh ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, as he would haue it, may ſee, that as I haue dealt in all things plainely and ſincerely, ſo this fellow dealeth moſt childiſhly, impudently &amp; idlely in moſt of his diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>To conuince me of <hi>ridiculous vanitie in vaunting,</hi> (as he calleth it) he alleageth nothing, but only a challenge made by me to himſelfe in fiue new encounters. I do alſo requeſt, if himſelfe be buſie about ſome packe or practiſe of treaſon, or els percaſe about ſome plot to win a Cardinals hat, &amp; wil not or hath no leiſure to anſwere; that either <hi>Creſwel,</hi> or ſome other babling <hi>Iebuſite</hi> may be ſet forth to try his ſkill in this combat. But neither is it a ridiculous matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the truth, nor any vanity to challenge <hi>Parſons,</hi> or his paltry ſchollers, and ſeditious companions. Beſide that, if it be vanitie in vs to challenge ſome few, then ſhould <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> be a moſt notorious vaine fellow, that in defence of his Cenſure againſt maſter <hi>Charke,</hi> doth moſt proudly challenge the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> to diſpute, and in his Wardword vanteth that we dare not to deale with him and his fellowes. <hi>Campian</hi> alſo challenged all commers, in his ten reaſons, as if a common fencer ſhould challenge all men at ten weapons. And yet <hi>Parſons</hi> I trow, will not accuſe him of ridiculous vanitie in vanting. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the ſeditious crew of traitorous ſeminary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title of <hi>Thraſo, Goliah, Behemoth,</hi> or <hi>Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan</hi> to all challengers. For then could not ruffling ſir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> nor cauilling <hi>Campian</hi> eſcape their cenſure: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring eſpecially that in all their pamphlets they breath furie out of their noſtrils, and folly out of their dried ſculs, bragging and vanting moſt vainely and exceſſiuely. But
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18556:131"/> 
                     <hi>Parſons</hi> ſpeaking againſt others, forgetteth alwaies to looke backe vpon himſelfe, or elſe age perhaps hath dried vp his wit. <hi>Omnia fert aetas, animum quoque,</hi> ſaith the Poet,<note place="margin">Virgil. Eglog</note> 
                     <hi>age de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth all things,</hi> &amp; <hi>Parſons</hi> vnderſtanding alſo. His braine is dryed with Spaniſh ſacke, and Spaniſh ſcabbes haue ſeized on his ſcull.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, not being able to iuſtifie his thréefold accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt my Epiſtle, he roueth at certaine perſonall matters farre from the queſtions in controuerſie. Firſt he ſaith, <hi>I haue bene a ſouldier,</hi> but what of that? was not <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt founder of his ſect, a lame ſouldier? And were not Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth, <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond, and other Popes, whom he dare not diſclaime, great men of warre? Let him therefore beware, leaſt deſiring to ſtrike others, he wound the lame ſouldier his founder, and the Popes his holy fathers, and himſelfe, that counterfeiteth ſometime to be a ſouldier, and calleth himſelfe captaine <hi>Cowbucke,</hi> being but a cow and a coward. But it may be percaſe, that he accompteth it <hi>irregularitie,</hi> for a man of the Church to be a ſouldier: for ſo he ſeemeth to inſinuate. But he is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in his own canons. For albeit, to be a baſtard is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, yet is it not ſo to be a ſouldier. And if it were ſo by the Popes laws, who (becauſe the <hi>Iews</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Ioan. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to put any to death</hi>) do therefore exclude their clergie from iudging of matters of death; yet it is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to exact the obſeruation of the Popes lawes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when the papiſts do reaſon ſo abſurdly from the words of the Iewes, and regard their owne conſtitutions nothing at all. Beſide that, if ſuch traitors as himſelfe and the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> thinke it lawfull to beare armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their liege Souereignes; I hope he cannot diſproue them that haue ſerued their princes againſt foreine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and traitors.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith alſo, <hi>I haue bene a pirate.</hi> But that ſheweth, he is badly informed, and worſe affected, that calleth all that ſerue their countrey by ſea, pirats. As for me, I count it honour, to be rayled on by profeſſed enemies of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18556:132"/> their Prince and countrey, and ſhall the rather endeuour to do ſeruice both againſt enemies, traitors and railers.</p>
                  <p>Further, ſaith he, <hi>I vnderſtand, that he hath bene iudge marſhall among ſouldiers.</hi> But while he thinketh to offer me diſgrace, he ſaith more honour of me, then I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe haue ſayd of my ſelfe, if I had not bene occaſioned by him. For that is a place of honour, as the Auditors ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> armies can aſſure him. Neither is the ſame incompatible with my calling, although I ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the <hi>Queene</hi> in that place in the low countries, before I had any function in the Church.</p>
                  <p>He is alſo much offended, that I haue ſometime taken vpon me the trayning of yong ſouldiers, that were to be led againſt ſuch villeines and traitors as himſelfe, comming with <hi>Spainiards,</hi> and forraine enemies againſt their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But if he be ſorie that he and his conſorts could not cut his countrimens throats without reſiſtance, I am glad, if I haue made my countrimen the more able to ſerue both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt common enemies, and ſuch cut-throate traitors: and I doubt not but to vſe my ſkil to the benefit of my country, if euer ſuch traitors as himſelfe is, offer to bring with him any bougerly <hi>Italians,</hi> or bragadocio <hi>Spaniards</hi> againſt <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He proceedeth and ſaith, <hi>I am married and matched, as a miniſter ought to be.</hi> In an other place he glanceth at my wiues French hood. But what if I was married before I entred into the miniſtery, and be able to maintaine her ſo without any profits of my Eccleſiaſticall liuings? Beſide that himſelfe being a filthy baſtard, and borne of a baſe queane, as the Quodlibetiſt being a goodly martyr in the Calendar of traitors telleth him, he ſheweth himſelfe both witleſſe and ſhameleſſe, to ſpeake againſt honorable mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and ſuch as are knowne to be deſcended of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full parentage. Furthermore he giueth vs occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the filthie maſſe-prieſts, monkes and Iebuſites, that abiuring lawfull marriage, burne in vnlawfull luſtes, and are knowne to be adulterers, fornicators, ſodomites, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18556:132"/> moſt beaſtly and ſwiniſh fellowes.</p>
                  <p>He ſhameth not alſo to affirme, <hi>that I was forced to retire out of Ireland for certaine iniurious ſpeeches againſt the Earle of Ormond, and the Iriſh nation.</hi> But what if the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> and the Iriſh nation will cleare me? Is not he a buſie fellow to meddle with their matters without fée? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what if I came away with the leaue and liking both of the generall and others? Wil it not appeare that he lieth like a ſhameleſſe fellow, without leaue or liking of any but himſelf, who like a monky liketh beſt his own deformities? But he may learne both, if he liſt to informe himſelfe either by Engliſh or Iriſh that knew thoſe matters, how they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. As for thoſe whom he ſtileth witneſſes, <hi>Omni exceptione maiores,</hi> they neuer receiued any greater diſgrace then in medling with me, and haue ſince declared themſelues to be men rather to be lamented for their folly, then credited for their dignitie.</p>
                  <p>But nothing is more ridiculous, then that <hi>Robert Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> ſhould find fault with my intemperancy of ſpéech, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I do but anſwer his intemperate and exorbitant inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiues, that in ſcurrility and rayling are ſuperlatiue. But if he will néeds find fault, let him bring reaſon, leaſt his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſéeme to want both wit and reaſon.</p>
                  <p>His laſt charge againſt me in his anſwer to my Epiſtle concerneth diſcontentment, and complaints againſt the State. But it is like the reſt, that is, fond, falſe, and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. For neither is it likely that I ſhould be diſcontent with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> preſent ſtate, or grieued with any ordinary charge, when both in moſt honorable actions, and in my publike writings, I haue to the vttermoſt of my power defended the State, and haue willingly put my ſelf to extraordinary charge in all ſeruices for my countrey. This reſolution alſo is both in my ſelfe and others, not onely to ſpend our goods, but our liues alſo in defence of our country and of the truth againſt all malignant firebrands of ſedition, and miſerable ſlaues of Antichriſt that ſhall dare to aſſayle the Realme. Finally, if in any thing I haue ſhewed diſcontent, it is in
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18556:133"/> that I haue ſéene ſuch notorious trechery, as is diſcouered in <hi>Parſons</hi> and his leud conſorts to eſcape vnpuniſhed, and ſometimes vncontrolled.</p>
                  <p>Not content to accuſe vs, the ranging fellow runneth out in diuers places, and rayleth with a wide and filthy mouth againſt the late noble Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whoſe calamity all that knew him do much lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and whoſe blood, I doubt not but God will require at all the hands of ſome of his conſorts that ſought to ſpill it, as he hath already begun to reuenge it in ſome principal perſons that eagerly followed the matter againſt him. Well, let vs ſée notwithſtanding what this Blackeſmiths dog hath to ſay againſt that noble lord.<note place="margin">Fol. 6. b.</note> Firſt, ſaith he, <hi>the Earle of Eſſex was pitifully ſeduced by the puritanes.</hi> But euery one that is not ignorant of the true cauſes of his diſcontentment, knoweth well, that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was not for religion, but rather for other cauſes. It is alſo well knowne, that ſir <hi>Chriſtopher Blunt,</hi> and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faction was the cauſe of his ruine. For vnderſtanding his diſcontentment, they ſet him forward with hope and promiſe of aſſiſtance in priuate quarels, not doubting, but either to trouble the ſtate by his means, or els to bring him into a ſnare, whom they knew to be firme for religion. It may be alſo, that his enemies by their cunning drew him into this dangerous action, by practiſe of traiterous compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that were about him. Howſoeuer it was, much it is to be lamented, that refuſing a penſion offered him by the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he could not alſo diſcouer this traine layed for him by the Popes agents. And I cannot but much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, that ſo baſtardly and baſe a ſwaine as this paltry <hi>Parſons</hi> is, ſhould inſult ouer ſo noble and magnanimous an Earle: a dog ouer a Lyon: a bauling curre ouer a moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and worthy man of warre.</p>
                  <p>He telleth vs further, <hi>that he was ſtout againſt peace with forraine princes,</hi> and <hi>that he had wrought ſuch a troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnder hand, that if his ſtreame had not bene turned againſt him, he might chance to haue inhooked the greateſt fiſh in England.</hi> But this deuiſe of a great fiſh, is nothing but
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18556:133"/> a vaine ſurmiſe of a great conger-headed companion. For neither did he, nor could he pretend any title to the crowne. And as for his ſtoutneſſe againſt peace with <hi>Spaine,</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded from the loue of his country, and was occaſioned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on iuſt grounds, for that he ſaw no ſincere dealing on the behalfe of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but rather a ſurceaſing of hoſtility, that in the meane while Maſſe-prieſts and Iebuſites, and their adherents might worke treaſon. It may be alſo, that he meant to ſhew the weakneſſe of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> &amp; the power of the Engliſh nation, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore too much deſpiſed. Neither he certes, nor any man elſe miſliketh an honorable, profitable, ſafe, and durable peace. Fol. <hi>8.</hi> a. he doth againe talke vainely, and telleth vs of the Eſſexian aſſault, and ſayth, <hi>it may be preſumed, that it would haue abbreuiated the Queenes dayes, eſpecially in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the puritanes.</hi> But he is an abſurd fellow to obiect that which his greateſt enemies ſought to proue, and of which he cleared himſelf ſufficiently at the barre. And moſt ſhameleſſe he ſheweth himſelf, to impute that to men of our profeſſion, which like a leud <hi>Laiolian</hi> he calleth <hi>puritanes,</hi> which was continually deſired of Papiſts, and much feared of all that truly profeſſed religion. Againe, fol. <hi>13.</hi> he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth the Earle of <hi>Eſſex his attempt, and golden purpoſes,</hi> and ſayth, <hi>that my Lord and young king Eſſex plotted her Maieſties ouerthrow vnder pretence of meeting at a puritane ſermon.</hi> But if all plotters of her Maieſties ouerthrow had bin rewarded according to their deſert, then had the crowes long ere this fed on <hi>Parſons</hi> his quarters, the moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arch-plotter of treaſon that this age hath affoorded. Likewiſe he and his conſorts haue made many attempts againſt the State, and in the deſtruction of their Quéen and country they hoped to haue a new world, and therin placed their golden time. As for the good Earle, his purpoſes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they were drawne to his deſtruction, and diſorderly managed, yet could no man proue that he meant harme to the Quéene. Séeing therefore this Patch obiecteth to the Earle an imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which the traiterous conſorts
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:18556:134"/> of <hi>Parſons</hi> haue long deſired: I will here beſtow on him a crowne of fox tayles, and make him the King of al renegate traitors: and doubt not if he come into <hi>England,</hi> but to ſée him crowned at <hi>Tiburne,</hi> and his quarters enſtalled at <hi>Newgate</hi> and <hi>Moregate.</hi> Finally, fol. <hi>88.</hi> b. he doth againe inculcate the ſame matters, and pretendeth <hi>that he was ſet on by certaine puritanes and hungrie proteſtants.</hi> But if he knew any of vs guilty of ſuch a crime, I doubt not but he would haue reuealed their names, vſing to kéepe nothing ſecret that might hurt vs. We haue rather great cauſe to ſuſpect Papiſts, who were the principall men about him, and ſome percaſe ſuborned by the Spaniſh <hi>Infantaes</hi> faction that feared him, and by all meanes ſought his deſtruction. And thus euery man may ſee, that no man euer pleaded the Popes cauſe with worſe grace then <hi>Parſons,</hi> who obiecteth nothing to his aduerſaries, but that which falleth beſide them, and reboundeth backe on himſelfe and his friends.</p>
                  <p>In the places aboue mentioned, he endeuoreth alſo to ſprinkle ſome ſuſpition vpon ſir <hi>Francis</hi> and me, as if we had bene priuy to the Earles intentions. But we were too farre off to be partakers of his counſels, and too far different from ſir <hi>Chr. Blunt</hi> and other Papiſts to conſort with them: and I may boldly ſay, not ſo ſimple as to allow of ſuch an action. <hi>Parſons</hi> therefore may do well, either to forbeare ſuch fooliſh toyes, or to take better information of matters. He calleth the Earle my maſter: but therein he is no leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, then in the reſt. For albeit I haue in diuers actions ſerued vnder him; yet ſo did diuers others Knights &amp; Lords that neuer called him maſter.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>20.</hi> he giueth out fooliſh words, as if ſome of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which he calleth Puritanes, ſhould intend <hi>to take ſome port or towne in England.</hi> But that, as it is a matter far from our doctrine and practiſe, ſo it is common with the Papiſts, as may be proued by the example of ſuch as came with the <hi>Spaniards, an. 1597. &amp; 98.</hi> for <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and of the traiterous leaguers the Popes bleſſed ſouldiers in <hi>France.</hi> Was not then ſir <hi>Robert</hi> a woodden diſcourſer, that hath no
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18556:134"/> fault to obiect againſt vs, which he can proue, and yet ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth diuers things, whereof his owne conſorts are moſt guilty?</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>25.</hi> a. Taxing me for diuers faults, this maſked <hi>O.E</hi> ſayth he, <hi>ſhewing himſelfe no leſſe full of malice, and poiſoned hatred againſt Catholikes, then furious in hereſie, falleth from flattering her Maieſtie, to bloodie ſycophancie and calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Catholikes, as though they hated her Maieſties perſon.</hi> Whereto that I may anſwer according to <hi>Parſons</hi> owne vaine, I ſay that this maſked <hi>N.D.</hi> ſheweth himſelfe an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious Noddy, that chargeth men with malice, poyſoned hatred againſt Catholikes, fury, hereſie, calumniation and ſycophancy, and yet neither nameth who theſe Catholikes are, nor bringeth one letter to iuſtifie his furious accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I ſay further, that he is neither Catholike nor honeſt man, but a furious ſycophant, hired for cruſts of bread to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate honeſt men, and an irreligious apoſtate and heretike, and yet not more wicked for religion, then damnable for his odious conuerſation. And where I ſay that Papiſts, as many as were linked to <hi>Parſons</hi> and his packing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts, were enemies to her Maieſties perſon: their manifold plots and attempts againſt her Maieſty, &amp; their continuall adhearing to her enemies, do proue my ſaying true. <hi>Parſons</hi> alſo hath by diuers libels, and namely by <hi>Philopater,</hi> which he denieth to be his, and by the printing and publiſhing of <hi>Sanders</hi> booke <hi>de Schiſmate,</hi> and the libell which was partly made by him, and partly by <hi>Allen,</hi> and by diuers practiſes againſt her life and ſtate, proued himſelfe to be a dogge in barking, and a poyſoned enemie in conſpiring againſt her. We will onely alledge a few lines out of <hi>Allens</hi> libell prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Parſons</hi> againſt the Queene. <hi>She is</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>a moſt vniuſt vſurper, an open iniurer of all nations, an infamous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued, accurſed, excommunicate hereticke, the very ſhame of her ſexe and princely name, the chiefe ſpectacle of ſinne and abhomination in this our age, and the onely poyſon, calamity, and deſtruction of our noble Church and countrey.</hi> Now would I gladly know, whether thoſe that allow this forme
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18556:135"/> of writing, did not both hate and ſéeke to hurt her Maieſty. Next, whether ſuch as do allow ſuch malicious railing and libelling, do not concurre with them in hatred, and deſerue to be hated and expulſed out of all kingdomes well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as leud libellers, venimous ſerpents, and damnable traitors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let any man reade the firſt page of the Wardword</hi> (ſayth <hi>Parſons) and then tell me whether this miniſter haue any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head at al (though his head be great inough) who ſaith, I do not ſo much as go about to proue any ſuch matter, that he flattered the ſtate.</hi> And this ſaith he, forgetting his owne brazen face and forehead, and the blackſmiths his mothers huſbands forked head, and his mothers litle honeſtie recorded in ſo many bookes of the ſecular prieſts, and ſpoken of commonly in the country. Beſide that, it is moſt apparent that he doth not once mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſir <hi>Francis</hi> in the firſt page of his book, ſaue in the title, much leſſe proue him a flatterer. And if as he ſaith, <hi>that was the but of his diſcourſe,</hi> then like a blind archer he miſſed the but, &amp; ſhot wide and far off. It appeareth alſo, that he was not in his wits, when he began thus to exclaim and cry alarme.</p>
                  <p>Fol, <hi>35.</hi> he imputeth vnto me <hi>idle babling and calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> whereas all his waſt <hi>Warne-word</hi> is nothing but a fardle of idle words, and méere babling, and foolery, except where he addeth ſome additions of knauery; &amp; that not only in calumniation and lying, but alſo in diuers kinds of villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and trechery.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>36.</hi> he ſayth, <hi>I flatter to get a bigger benefice.</hi> But if a man ſhould aſke him, how he knoweth my mind, he wil like a reſtie iade be at a ſtop. Onely he imagineth me to be like himſelfe, who cauſed a ſolemne ſupplication to be preſented to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſubſcribed with the hands of diuers baſe knaues and whores for want of more worthy witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, declaring, that to vphold the cacolike cauſe, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> ſhould be made forſooth no leſſe then a Cardinall. He made meanes alſo for the Kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Pope to the ſame effect. And no doubt they had
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18556:135"/> taken effect, but that he had iugled too much aboue the boord, and was knowne to be a baſtardly, baſe, refuſe, ribaldicall, raſcall fellow.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>72.</hi> ſpeaking of ſir <hi>Francis,</hi> like <hi>Scogan</hi> he ſcorneth, and like an impudent companion accuſeth him, <hi>as not aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in good workes:</hi> whereas himſelf aboundeth in all euil workes, as for example, impietie, hereſie, trechery, filchery, lying, cogging, lechery, beaſtly filthineſſe, and all knauery. As for ſir <hi>Francis</hi> his pietie &amp; charitable dealing, the ſame is ſufficiently knowne: and greatly ſhould I wrong him, if I ſhold compare him with any of <hi>Parſons</hi> his conſorts, which was begotten on the backſide of a ſmiths forge, in that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where ſir <hi>Francis</hi> hath an honorable charge.</p>
                  <p>In his ſecond <hi>Encounter, ca. 13. ſuch ruffianlike and raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous companions</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do poſſeſſe, buy and ſell Catholike benefices:</hi> forgetting that himſelf wandred long vp &amp; down <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> ſometime in the habite of a ſouldier, ſometime like a ruffianlike Leno, ſometime like a knitter of thrummed caps, and that himſelfe liued long by rapine, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinage and knauery. He forgot alſo how the Popes, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and Maſſe-prieſts buy and ſell benefices, maſſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and ſuch <hi>Babylonical</hi> wares, as I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſhewed.

                  <p>To proue that Catholike men cannot receiue their faith from the Catholike Church, that is, <hi>a collection and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all faithful people:</hi> I thinke that I néeded not to vſe many arguments, the ſame being a matter ſo plain and euident. For then ſhould the receiuers be no Catholikes, nor ſhould the Catholike church conſiſt of particular men. And finally, al the members of the Catholike church ſhould be agents to deliuer, and all members to receiue, and no diſtinction ſhould be betwéene the giuer and receiuer. But I vſed onely one argument, drawne from a common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſchoolemen, viz. <hi>that actions are acted of ſingular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not of the body collectiue:</hi> ſuppoſing that I had had to do with a ſchoole-man, or a man at the leaſt that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood logicke.

For otherwiſe he would not haue talked ſo idly of <hi>ſuppoſitum</hi> and <hi>ſingulare,</hi> and <hi>vniuerſale,</hi> nor deriued his logick from <hi>Tolet,</hi> nor denied my argument. For if in God the whole eſſence doth ſuffer, and not the ſonne of God, or if the whole eſſence ſhould be borne, and not the ſonne of God, as <hi>Parſons</hi> muſt graunt, if he will haue actions to proceed <hi>à toto collectiuo:</hi> then doth he fall flatly into the hereſie of the <hi>Patripaſſians,</hi> &amp; ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the high myſtery of the holy Trinitie.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18556:141"/> and not to the vniuerſall body of the Church. The ſame is alſo proued by the example of a body politicke.

Muſt all méete, &amp; like a <hi>Chorus</hi> ſpeak or act a part? O meere dizardry! O piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ignorance, and that to be corrected with many ſtripes! Nay himſelfe in the end is driuen to ſay, fol. <hi>109.</hi> that when Papiſts ſay, <hi>that their faith is deliuered by the vniuerſall church, their meaning is, that albeit particular prieſts, &amp;c. deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſame, yet for that they do it not as of themſelues, but by the order of the vniuerſall church, that the vniuerſall church deliuereth it.</hi> So you ſée he commeth like a reſty iade to the <hi>montoier,</hi> and ſayth as we ſay in effect; and to helpe himſelfe belyeth his fellowes.

                     </hi> A teſtimonie that may fitly be applied to him. For he is an hereticall man, and hath bene often warned of his faults, albeit we ſée no amendment in him. He ſinneth alſo, as may be gueſſed, againſt his owne conſcience, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which being in <hi>England</hi> ſomtimes he condemned, and is vtterly ſubuerted and damned, if God do not in his great mercie recall him.

Neither doth <hi>Parſons</hi> alleage this place againſt vs impertinently, but alſo falſly. The words of the Apoſtle are theſe, <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which emport thus much, <hi>And ſinneth being condemned by himſelfe:</hi> and not as <hi>Parſons</hi> tranſlateth: viz. <hi>And ſinneth damnably againſt his owne iudgement.</hi> Where this word <hi>damnably,</hi> and <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is added to the Apoſtles ſentence moſt falſly. For euery heretike after once or twiſe admonition doth not ſinne damnably againſt his owne iudgement, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the Popes, their Cardinals, and others, that think they do well percaſe, albeit noble and notorious heretikes. But rather euery heretike doth by his leud opinions, which he will not reforme, ſeuer and diuide himſelfe from the Church, and as the Apoſtle ſaith, ſinneth, <hi>being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by his owne act, or by him ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewiſe do the reſt of his teſtimonies and authorities ſerue fitly againſt himſelfe. In the beginning of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, fol. <hi>1.</hi> he aymeth at the Apoſtles words, <hi>2. Tim. 2.</hi> Where he forbiddeth vs <hi>to contend about words, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit nothing, but to peruert the hearers. Robert Parſons</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Apoſtles words ſo, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of words tendeth to nothing, but the ſubuerſion of the hearers.</hi> But the Apoſtle talketh of <hi>contention about words,</hi> and not <hi>of contention of words:</hi> and of the effect, and not of tending to an end. But to omit his error in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſay that nothing could be more fitly ſpoken againſt <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> then this, which the Apoſtle here vttereth. For what with his <hi>Wardword,</hi> and his <hi>Warneword,</hi> and his idle contention about words, he hath abuſed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted his ſimple and credulous followers, that looked for better things at his hands. And therefore leauing as much as we can, his brabling words, we anſwere that, which is
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:18556:151"/> moſt materiall of his diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame leafe, he addeth another text out of the <hi>26.</hi> of the Prouerbs, where the wiſe man aduiſeth vs, <hi>to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere a foole according to his folly, leaſt he thinke himſelfe wiſe.</hi> According whereunto we haue ſhaped an anſwere to <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> his <hi>Warneword,</hi> praying him very heartily to take it in good part, and not to thinke himſelfe ouer wiſe in his owne conceit, ſeeing the author of that péece could neuer haue vttered ſuch ſtuffe, vnleſſe he had bene a thrée piled foole, and had attained to a higher degree, then a Cardinall in the conſiſtory of fooles.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe theſe words out of <hi>Ciceroes</hi> oration in <hi>Vatini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which he like a dolt ſuppoſeth to be taken out of <hi>Tullies</hi> ſecond <hi>Philppic, viz. <hi>vt vexatum potiùs, quàm deſpectum vellem dimittere,</hi>
                     </hi> doe fit vs as well againſt <hi>Parſons,</hi> as may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed. For albeit he be but a baſe, baſtardly, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible fellow, and almoſt ſpent out in rayling and libelling, and diſcraſied in plotting of treaſon and villany; yet haue I thought it better to ſend him away well corrected, then to paſſe by him as a worthleſſe and deſpiſed companion. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I doubt, but to returne him as large a meaſure of baſtonadoes, as he hath offered others, and ſo to handle him, that his friends ſhall ſay he is dreſſed like a calues head ſouced in veriuyce.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words of our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn 3. He that doth euill, hateth the light, and will not come to it, leaſt his workes ſhould be reproued;</hi> he applieth to me. And why? Forſooth becauſe to anſwere Capt. <hi>Cowbuckes</hi> fencing <hi>Wardword,</hi> ſet out vnder the name of <hi>N.

But againſt me theſe obiections come all too late. For albeit at the firſt I could haue bene content to haue bene vnknowne in this fooliſh brable betwixt <hi>Parſons</hi>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:18556:151"/> and me, and that not ſo much in regard of any thing ſayd by me, as in regard of the baſtardly companion, with whom I am matched, being an aduerſary, of any learned man to be ſcorned. And not leaſt of all, becauſe ſuch contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies would rather be handled in Latin, then in Engliſh: yet being occaſioned to renew my challenge, I haue ſet my name vnto it, and declared, that I neither feare light, nor the foules of darkneſſe, nor néed to looke for ſpoyle, as this rauinous Iebuſite pretendeth. Againſt <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> this text and obiection cometh both fitly and timely. For albeit he obiecteth ciphring of names to others, yet will he not diſcipher his owne name vnto vs. Nay, albeit we know his name and qualitie very well; yet will he not bewray himſelfe, albeit often admoniſhed of his playing the owle. He hath long bene plotting of treaſon, and therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the light. He hath for many yeares gone maſked like a vagabond vp and downe England, and in the day time hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den himſelfe in corners. He hath long looked to diuide the ſpoile of his country with ſtrangers. What then reſteth, ſeeing he will not be diſmaſked, but that ſome of <hi>Buls</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie doe vnmaſke him, vncaſe him, and truſſe him?</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe fol. <hi>12.</hi> he calleth me <hi>Owle,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>He will draw me to the light.</hi> But this foule ſhold haue remembred, that himſelfe in a paltry pamphlet, which he ſet forth to diſſwade men from coming to Church, tooke on him the name of <hi>Iohn Houler,</hi> as a fit name for ſuch a night bird, and that this is one of his owne proper titles. Likewiſe, fol. <hi>14.</hi> b. he calleth me <hi>Owles eye,</hi> becauſe I borrow the two letters <hi>O.E.</hi> But if <hi>O.E.</hi> ſignifieth owles eye, then doth <hi>N.D.</hi> ſignifie either a Naſty Dunſe, or a North Iſland dog, or a notorious dolt, by as good reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>18.</hi> to proue the Popes headſhip ouer the whole Church, his noddiſhip alleageth the law, <hi>inter claras.

Beſide that, this law doth quite ouerthrow the Popes cauſe. For whereas the Pope clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18556:152"/> his authoritie by the law of God, this law ſayth, <hi>That the Romiſh Church was declared to be head of all Churches, by the rules of fathers, by the ſtatutes of Princes, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors fauourable ſpeeches. <hi>Quam eſſe omnium eccleſiarum ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put,</hi>

                  <p>Fol. <hi>23.</hi> ſpeaking of the bleſſings mentioned by <hi>Sir Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Haſtings,</hi> he ſayth, <hi>They were freſhly framed out of the forge of his owne inuention.</hi> But he was not aware, that this belongeth to Vulcane the blackeſmithes putatiue ſonne <hi>Parſons,</hi> whom from his infancy might in his puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue father <hi>Cowbuckes</hi> forge learne to forge, frame and inuent nayles to tacke the Popes triple crowne to his bald head.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were it truly alleaged, yet doth it not belong to any more properly, then to popiſh heretikes. For if all the bangling Iebuſites were coupled together like hounds; yet would they ſooner hang together, then agrée together. And that may appeare both by the ſchoolemens diſputes one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another in all queſtions almoſt, and alſo by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines bookes</hi> of controuerſies, and <hi>Suares</hi> his tedious fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, about ſchoole matters: in which they are as much at variance with themſelues, as with others.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame place he taxeth vs, <hi>for confuſed writing.</hi> And yet if you ſéeke all the ſinkes of the Popes libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I do hardly beléeue, that you ſhall find a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed farrago of words and matters, then the <hi>Warne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word</hi> ſet out by <hi>Robert Parſons.</hi> For therein the man run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as it were the wild gooſe chaſe, and heapeth vp a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of foolery like to nothing, vnleſſe it be to a bundle of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len tailors ſhreds, wherein friſe, and carſey liſtes, locrome,

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would the kingdome of Satan ſtand, if it were diuided in it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>S. Auguſtine <hi>contra Iulian. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</hi> alleaged by <hi>Parſons,</hi> fol. <hi>77.</hi> b. fall right vpon his head.

For none but they did loſe that towne.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>83.</hi> he talketh of the chaſtitie of Friers, Monkes, and prieſts, which as he ſignifieth, haue ghelt themſelues for the kingdome of heauen. And yet the Monk <hi>Heywood</hi> his true father was not very chaſt when he begot him. Nor was <hi>Parſons</hi> ghelt for the kingdome of heauen, when he begot children on his owne ſiſter, as <hi>A.C.</hi> ſayth, or when he got his hurts in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> which yet ſticke to his rotten ſhins: nor are the Popes, and Cardinals, and Maſſeprieſts, that commonly kéepe concubines, if not worſe, very holy eunuches. Of <hi>D. Giffard</hi> and <hi>Weſton,</hi> I ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake otherwhere. Furthermore, he is often talking of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18556:153"/> great heads, alwayes forgetting the branched head of the blacke ſmith his putatiue father.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>84.</hi> and <hi>85.</hi> he is not aſhamed to talke of ciuil wars, murders, and other calamities in <hi>France, Flanders</hi> and other countries, when he cannot denie but that the Popes bloody buls, and the Iebuſites the firebrands of ſedition, and their agents haue bene the beginners of all theſe troubles, and the principall maſſacrers of innocent men. Was he then wel in his wits, trow you, to talk of his owne deare fathers cruelties, and to accuſe Chriſts ſheepe, as cauſe of the wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh Papiſts notorious murders and cruell executions?</p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>Parſons</hi> aſketh <hi>Sir Francis, whether he hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of faith by his owne reading, or by the credite of ſome others:</hi> we may aſke his friarſhip likewiſe, or becauſe he is but a doogeon dunce, of the Pope, who is, as it were, an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Papiſts, the ſame queſtion. And if he anſwer, that he hath it by his owne reading, then we ſhall much wonder at his impudencie. For <hi>Parſons</hi> knoweth that Popes reade li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing, and for the moſt part are ignorant of ſchoole diuinitie. If he ſay his Popeſhip hath it by the vertue of his cloſe ſtool, then is the ſame but filthy learning, eſpecially the Pope being laxatiue, as was <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourteenth. If he ſay, he haue it from his Maſſe-prieſts and friars, then are they more certaine oracles then he; and this learning muſt come from the tayles of friars, and not from the head of the church. <hi>Parſons</hi> therefore to cleare this doubt, fol. <hi>110.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That they do not depend on the Pope as a priuate man, but as he is head and chiefe paſtor of Chriſts vniuerſal Church.</hi> He ſaith alſo, <hi>That his rudeneſſe is turned into wiſedome.</hi> But that the Pope is the head of Chriſts vniuerſall Church, is the thing in queſtion. That a man ſhould be a ſot, as he is a priuate man, and wiſe as he is a publike perſon, is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. That he is made wiſe and learned being made Pope, is moſt falſe. So it appeareth, <hi>Parſons</hi> is enſnared in his owne queſtion, and muſt confeſſe that the faith of papiſts is nothing elſe but the Popes priuate fancie, and grounded on the Popes chaire, and moſt abſurd and ſottiſh: which can
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:18556:154"/> not be obiected to vs, ſéeing we ground our ſelues vpon the Apoſtles and Prophets, who in matters of faith &amp; ſaluation ſpeake plainely, and alwayes the ſame things moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</p>
                  <p>In his firſt encounter, chap <hi>15.</hi> he ſpendeth much talke about the rule of faith. But moſt of his words are direct contrary both to himſelfe and to his holy fathers profite. For in the <hi>Wardword,</hi> page <hi>6.</hi> he ſaid, <hi>the vniuerſal Church was the ſquire and pole-ſtar, which euery one was to follow:</hi> confounding like an ideot the thing ruled with the rule. In the <hi>Warneword</hi> fol. <hi>100.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>the ſumme and corpes of Chriſtian doctrine deliuered at the beginning by the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles &amp; preachings of the Apoſtles,</hi> is the rule of faith. Which is contrary to the Popes profit. For if this be true, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Popes determinations and traditions eccleſiaſtical were preached by the Apoſtles and confirmed by mracles, they are to be excluded from being the rule of faith.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This being the <hi>Adelantadoes</hi> proclamation <hi>anno 1598.</hi> let the world iudge of the impudencie of <hi>Parſons,</hi> that lyeth wittingly, and ſaith, <hi>the alarme was falſe.</hi> Thereby it may appeare alſo, what maner of man <hi>Parſons</hi> is, that bringeth forreine enemies vpon his countrey, and is conſorted with them, and yet faceth all downe that ſhall ſay the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>In his Epiſtle likewiſe he ſaith, <hi>that the Wardword com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming abroade, the newes was in moſt mens mouthes, that the Knight diſauowed the Watchword, attributing the ſame to certaine Miniſters.</hi> Where, me thinkes, I heare <hi>Thraſo</hi> ſay, <hi>Metuebant omnes me: <hi>All ſtood in dread of me.</hi>
                     </hi> But that is not the fault that I meane here to touch. For it is his egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious lying, that we are here to talke of. Let him therefore either name theſe moſt men that he mentioneth, or at the leaſt ſome honeſt man, that gaue out this report as from ſir <hi>Francis</hi> his mouth, or elſe we muſt ſay, that this lie came out of his owne foule mouth, that is now become a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of lies. He muſt ſhew alſo how <hi>Sir Francis</hi> could diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now a treatiſe ſubſcribed and publiſhed by himſelfe, or elſe it will be ſaid, that this report of <hi>Parſons</hi> is a lie, without ſhew or probabilitie.</p>
                  <p>Afterward he affirmeth, <hi>that a certaine Miniſter wrote in ſupply of the Knights defence.</hi> And againe, fol. <hi>1.</hi> he telleth, <hi>how I peruſing the reply of <hi>Sir Francis,</hi> thought in mine owne opinion to make a better defence.</hi> But how can he proue that I peruſed the Knights anſwere,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:18556:157"/> or once ſaw it? And whence doth he gather, what opinion I had of mine owne doings? If he proue nothing, then will it be an eaſie matter to gather, that he hath made two impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable lies. The ſame is proued alſo, for that my reply was made before the Knights Apologie was publiſhed or ſeene of me. For if I had ſeene it firſt, my labour might well haue bin ſpared, the ſame being more then ſufficient for the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuch a banglers babling diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>In his obſeruations vpon my preface, fol. <hi>11.</hi> b. he ſayth, <hi>My proiect and purpoſe of writing, is to irritate and ſtir vp her Maieſty, and the Councel, to ingulfe themſelues in Catholikes bloud, and to ſpoile their goods, that I and my crew might come to haue a ſhare.</hi> But firſt it is moſt falſe, that Papiſts are Catholikes. Secondly, no one word can he alleage out of my whole book, wherby it may be gathered, that I would haue any rigour vſed againſt ſuch ſimple Papiſts, that are not factious nor mutinous. For all the harme I wiſh them, is, that they were wel inſtructed. Thirdly, if he meane thoſe traitors, that either came or meant to ioyne with the <hi>Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantado</hi> againſt their prince and countrey: then are they no Catholikes, nor true ſubiects. The ſame may be ſaid alſo of <hi>Parſons</hi> his conſorts. Finally, it is a ſhameleſſe vntruth to ſay, we deſire either blood or ſpoile; all our actions tending onely to reſiſt forrein enemies, and wicked traitors, which ſéeke to ſhed their countrimens blood like water, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice it to the Pope, and to giue the ſpoile of their country to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as the factious Maſſe-prieſts and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts their conſorts haue done diuers times, and namely <hi>an. 1588.</hi> and <hi>1598.</hi> and ſince.</p>
                  <p>In his obſeruations vpon <hi>Sir Francis</hi> his Epiſtle, fol. <hi>6. He obiecteth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Parſons) that I ſeeke the ruine both of church and common wealth by my exhortation to peace, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and mitigation in religion.</hi> A notorious lie, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by reading of <hi>Sir Francis</hi> his Apology, where there is no one word ſounding that way. Neither do we blame any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man that talketh of peace, but ſcorne, that traitors that haue warre in their hearts, ſhould talke of peace, and that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18556:157"/> idolaters and heretikes ſhould prate and talke of religion, when they meane nothing but to erect idolatrie, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh popiſh errors and ſuperſtition.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>16.</hi> ſpeaking of me, <hi>He bluſheth not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to affirme that which all his fellowes haue denied.</hi> And what is this, trow you? Forſooth, that blaſphemous and ſcandalous dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing heretikes may be put to death. But where he ſaith, that all my fellows haue denied this, he ſheweth him ſelfe a ſhameleſſe lying companion, and the diuels fellow in forging lies. For none of my fellowes euer denied that which I affirme, but only wold not haue ignorant, &amp; peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ſimple heretikes, that neither blaſpheme, nor dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſe, nor are offenſiue to the State, puniſhed with death. Likewiſe they condemne the cruell and bloody Papiſts, that burne &amp; maſſacre men, women and children, for denying or contradicting any one point of their filthy, abominable, and erronious doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>18.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>The Emperour in a certaine edict begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>reddentes: Cod. de ſum. Trin. &amp; fid. Cath.</hi> profeſſeth his due ſubiection, and of all his empire to the church of Rome:</hi> which is a notorious and an impudently. For in that law there is no one word to be found, that importeth ſubiection either of the Emperour, or of the Empire to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> much leſſe to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nay, at that time the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> belonged to the Emperour, which lately the Pope hath vſurped, excluding the Emperour from thence. But were there any thing contained in that law, which may ſeeme ſpoken in fauour of the Romane Biſhop, yet is the ſame proued counterfet in my late treatiſe concerning falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Romiſh ſynagogue.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>19.</hi> a. ſpeaking of the Emperors, <hi>They profeſſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Biſhops of Rome to be the heads and chiefe leaders of this vniuerſall and viſible Catholicke Church: as before hath bene ſhewed by the examples of <hi>Gratian, Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> and of <hi>Arcadius, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond, and of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to Pope <hi>Innocentius primus,</hi> and of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> to Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt.</hi>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:18556:158"/> This he ſaith boldly. But in theſe few words, a cluſter of lies is packed vp cloſe together. For neither do <hi>Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodſius</hi> write to <hi>Damaſus,</hi> as the title of the law, <hi>cunctos populos Cod. de ſum. trinit.</hi> doth ſhew, nor do they ſay, that <hi>Damaſus</hi> was head and leader of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall viſible Church. Nor do <hi>Arcadius, Honorius,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſus</hi> the ſecond talke of any ſuch matter to be due to <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> the firſt. Nor can it be proued out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> or <hi>Iuſtinians</hi> decrée, <hi>inter claras. Cod. de ſum. trinit.</hi> that this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was giuen to <hi>Innocentius</hi> the firſt, or <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt, or ſecond. For beſide that the law <hi>inter claras,</hi> is counterfeit, the interpreter doth corruptly tranſlate <gap reason="foreign" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>the head of all prieſts,</hi> the head of all Churches. Nay hardly will <hi>Parſons</hi> be able to ſhew, that any of theſe did ſpeake of the vniuerſall viſible Church, where they ſpeake of the biſhops of <hi>Romes</hi> authoritie. Theſe therefore are pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, if not viſible lies. And that which he ſaith of <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt, is a ridiculous lye. For he was dead, as Chronicles teach, before <hi>Iuſtinians</hi> reigne.</p>
                  <p>He thinketh it lawfull to lie all manner of lies of <hi>Caluin.</hi> And therefore boldly ſaith,<note place="margin">Fol. 20. a.</note> 
                     <hi>He was a prieſt,</hi> and that <hi>he ſayd maſſe.</hi> Both which are denyed by thoſe which wrote his life, which ſay he departed out of France <hi>before he receiued any orders.</hi> The ſame may be proued, for that his name is found in no biſhops records, and for that he begunne to write his Inſtitutions before <hi>24.</hi> yeares of age. Of which we gather, that he hated the popiſh prieſthood, before he was of yeares to be made prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>22.</hi> b. he maketh <hi>Sir Francis</hi> to ſay, <hi>that we haue changed old religion into Proteſtancy:</hi> not changing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his old faſhion of cogging and lying. For neither doth he, nor any of vs acknowledge popiſh religion to be aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nor do we call our religion <hi>proteſtancy:</hi> although his dealing giueth vs oft occaſion to proteſt againſt his wicked and falſe dealing.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>23.</hi> a. he affirmeth, that <hi>Sir Francis talketh of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but feares, frights and terrors.</hi> But he might doe well
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:18556:158"/> to ceaſe talking, if he tell nothing but lies. In the place mentioned <hi>Sir Francis</hi> talketh neither of <hi>feares, frights, nor terrors.</hi> Nor doth it follow, becauſe <hi>Parſons</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts are ſtill packing vnderhand, and dealing with the Spaniards, that we are terrified. For we haue neither cauſe to feare treaſon, nor publike force, vnleſſe we will truſt traytors, and wilfully throw away our armes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue Papiſts cauſe to begin to ſtirre, vnleſſe they be weary of their liues, of peace, of eaſe, and of their natiue countrey.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>25.</hi> a. he boldly auoucheth, that I count it a bleſſing, <hi>to haue Catholike rites and ſeruice aboliſhed:</hi> whereas in truth I deſire nothing more, then that Catholike religion may be reſtored, and ſpeake onely againſt the filthy abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of popiſh maſſe, the idolatrous worſhip of ſaints and idols, the tyranny of the Pope, and ſuch like: which none but the ſlaues of Antichriſt can endure, and wil affirme to be Catholike.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Iouinian</hi> and <hi>Vigilantius</hi> held ſome errors, we will not deny. But <hi>that Hierome called them heretikes for the ſame points that wee hold, concerning virginitie, prayers to ſaints, and lights at martyrs tombes,</hi> as <hi>Parſons</hi> fol. <hi>27.</hi> affirmeth moſt falſly, will not be proued. For <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> doth rather excuſe thoſe, that lighted candels at noone day, then condemne thoſe that thought contrary. Neither did he euer place perfection in forced virginity, or teach prayers to ſaints, or allow thoſe, that worſhipped falſe relikes, as the papiſts do. This therefore which <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> ſayth, is to be ſcored vp among the relikes of his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame leafe he addeth another groſſe lye, ſaying, <hi>That Iewell</hi> (writing) <hi>againſt Harding, and Fulke againſt Allen and Briſtow, do often call Saint Hierome borne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt and ſcolding doctor.</hi> For neither the one terme, nor the other is found in their writings. Nay we ſhould great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrong <hi>Saint Hierome,</hi> if we ſhould call him either papiſt, or <hi>borne papiſt,</hi> ſéeing that in his time neither the monſter
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:18556:159"/> of the maſſe, nor other popiſh abominations, were either borne, or conceiued. Vnleſſe therefore he quote <hi>B. Iewels,</hi> and <hi>M. Fulkes</hi> words; as he was borne a baſtard, ſo we will hold him by condition for a lying accuſer, and a ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding companion, and a fellow borne to tell lyes.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>28.</hi> b. he telleth loud lies of <hi>Panormitane,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That he in the chap. <hi>licet. de electione,</hi>
                     </hi> expounding theſe words of <hi>Hoſtienſis, <hi>Cum idem ſit Chriſti atque Papae conſiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quaſi omnia poteſt facere Papa, quae Chriſtus, excepto peccato:</hi> ſheweth the meaning to be, that in matters of iuriſdiction, and ſpirituall authoritie, for gouernment of his Church vpon earth, Chriſt hath left ſo great power vnto his ſubſtitute Saint Peters ſucceſſor, as he may do thereby, and in his name and vertue, whatſoeuer his maſter &amp; Lord might do in his Church, if he were now conuerſant among vs vpon earth.</hi> This I ſay, is a loud lye, conſiſting of two or thrée branches. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>Panormitan</hi> expound the words of <hi>Hoſtienſis:</hi> nor doth he affirme, that which <hi>Parſons</hi> writeth in his name. Nor is he ſo ſhameleſſe to write that which <hi>Parſons</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. A ſecond lye is alſo auouched by the forger of lyes <hi>Parſons,</hi> where he ſayth, <hi>That all both diuines &amp; canoniſts do agree, that all Chriſts power of gouernment is left to the Pope, except onely his power of excellency, according to that great commiſſion in Saint Matthew, I will giue vnto thee, the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, &amp;c.</hi> For neither all, nor any ancient father doth agrée to this concluſion, albeit we may boldly call them better diuines then the ſchoolemen: nor do all, or moſt of the Canoniſts ſpeake of this power of excellencie; nor do the words, <hi>Mat. 16.</hi> belong to the Pope, or conteine any ſuch commiſſion as is pretended. And that without alleaging further proofes, the Popes owne doctors will confeſſe. For <hi>Bellarmine <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Pontif. Rom. c.</hi> 10.</hi> ſheweth, that <hi>Peter had nothing granted in the 16. of Matth. but promiſed onely.</hi> And with him alſo diuers others are conſorted. But ſuppoſe any thing had bene granted to ſaint <hi>Peter;</hi> what maketh this to <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> and other Popes that are liker to <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> then to <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:18556:159"/>
                  <p>Likewiſe fol. <hi>29.</hi> b. he ſayth, <hi>That Panormitan and Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis vttering theſe words, <hi>Papa poteſt facere quaſi omnia quae Chriſtus, excepto peccato,</hi> do explicate the compariſon of Chriſt, not as he is God, but as he is man.</hi> Which ſheweth that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> taketh pleaſure in lying. For elſe why ſhould he ſay, that they explicate the compariſon of Chriſt, not as he is God, but as he is man, when they haue not one word ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this way?</p>
                  <p>In the ſame leafe, he belyeth the ſame man againe, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs, <hi>That Panormitan, <hi>de electione c. venerabilem,</hi> ſaith, that Hoſtienſis founded his doctrine vpon the commiſſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Pope, Matth. 16.</hi> Whereas <hi>Panormitan</hi> hath no ſuch words, nor doth in that place mention Chriſts words, <hi>Matth. 16.</hi> nor hath one word of any commiſſion giuen to the Pope by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>Fol. <hi>36.</hi> b. ſpeaking of <hi>Cromwell</hi> and biſhop <hi>Cranmer: The firſt of them,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>was principally employed in the ſayd Queenes condemnation and death, as appeareth yet by publike records, and the ſecond was vſed for her defamation after her death, as is extant at this day in the foreſayd ſtatute it ſelfe, where Cranmers ſentence is recorded iudicially giuen by him.</hi> This ſaith he, but ſo impudently and falſly, as the ſame may conuince him of moſt ſhameleſſe lying. For firſt there is no ſuch ſentence, as is here mentioned, recorded in the act, as any man may ſee, that liſteth to reade it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what needeth a ſentence of diuorce againſt her, that was now put to death, that diuorceth all marriages? Thirdly, no man euer grieued more at this act, and at that Quéenes death, then the <hi>Lord Cromwell.</hi> So farre was he off from being a ſtrickler in it. Finally, not onely printed ſtatutes, but the acts of the tower alſo do conuince this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes moſt ſhameleſſe reports. Do you then thinke that he bluſheth to ſay any thing, that is not aſhamed to lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt publike acts and records?</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>37.</hi> a. he ſaith, <hi>Cranmer carried about with him his woman in a trunke.</hi> An impudent popiſh fiction, for the which the inuenter and reporter deſerueth to be caſed in a
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:18556:160"/> clokebag. The truth is, that the reuerend biſhop fearing the Kings diſpleaſure, about the time of the ſixe articles, ſent his wife away into <hi>Germanie</hi> vnto her kinred. But if he had bene diſpoſed to haue kept her with him; yet nothing is more ridiculous or improbable, then that ſhe ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about in a trunke. And if <hi>Parſons</hi> were to be put in a trunk, he would ſay it were impoſſible to liue in it. He ſaith alſo, <hi>that for gaine of liuing or fauour, or quietly enioying his liuing, <hi>Cranmer</hi> would ſay or vnſay any thing:</hi> and for proofe he quoteth <hi>Sanders <hi>de ſchiſmate.</hi>
                     </hi> But lawyers may tell him, that ſuch domeſticall witneſſes are not worth a ruſh. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>That the teſtimonie of friends or fellowes is not to be accepted. <hi>Si amicus pro te dixerit</hi>
                     </hi> (ſaith he) <hi>non teſtis aut iudex, ſed fautor putabitur.</hi> This <hi>Sanders</hi> was a railing traitor, like to <hi>Parſons,</hi> and both of them hired to ſpeake ſhame againſt the profeſſors of the truth. If then a théefe is not to be credited, ſpeaking for his fellow théefe, nor a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor teſtifying for traitors: then let vs heare no more of this renegate raſcall traitor, that died in action againſt his countrey, conſorting himſelfe with the rebellious and thée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh Iriſh.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>40. They are wont to ſay</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that <hi>S. Bernard</hi> was no flatterer.</hi> But becauſe the man is wont to lie, no man will beléeue him, vnleſſe he bring forth the parties that haue ſo ſaid. For to call the Pope <hi>Abraham, Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech,</hi> and Chriſt, as <hi>Bernard</hi> doth, ſauoureth of the flattery and darkneſſe of thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, fifth, and ſixth chapters of <hi>Parſons</hi> his firſt encounter, are nothing elſe but a packe of lies, either recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, or deuiſed &amp; cogged by himſelf. He affirmeth firſt, <hi>that <hi>Carolſtadius, Oecolampadius,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> were <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> ſcholers.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that they were oppoſite to <hi>Luther.</hi>
                     </hi> Thirdly, <hi>that there were infinite opinions among them that denied the reall preſence. 4. That the Anabaptiſts roſe out of <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine. 5. That there was a potent diuiſion betwixt <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Illyricus.</hi> 6. That <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> iſſued from <hi>Zuinglius.</hi> 7. That <hi>Seruetus</hi> was <hi>Caluins</hi> collegue, and that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18556:160"/> he and <hi>Valentinus Gentilis</hi> and other heretikes came from <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> and <hi>Beza.</hi> 8. That we admit no iudge of controuerſies, and laugh at Councels. 9. That <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was condemned in a ſynod. 10. That out of our ſynods at <hi>Marpurge, Suabach,</hi> and <hi>Smalcald</hi> we departed with leſſe agreement then before, as <hi>Lauater</hi> and <hi>Sleidan</hi> teſtifie. 11. That <hi>Melancthon</hi> to proue the <hi>Zuinglians</hi> to be obſtinate heretikes, gathered together the ſentences of the ancient fathers for the reall preſence. 12. That <hi>Zuinglius</hi> died in rebellion againſt his countrey. 13. That <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> was found dead in bed by his wiues ſide, ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the deuill, as <hi>Luther</hi> holdeth, <hi>lib. de priuata miſſa,</hi> or kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his wife. 14. That great warres aroſe betweene <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> as he calleth them. 15. That <hi>Luther</hi> was the firſt father of our Goſpell; which he calleth, new. 16. That <hi>Stankare</hi> was a proteſtant,</hi> as he calleth him. <hi>17. That <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in a letter to the Elector of <hi>Brandeburg,</hi> doth cenſure the Queene of England, and the religion here profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 18. That there are warres and diſſentions in England in moſt principall points of religion.</hi> He doth alſo rehearſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other points, which are all vtterly falſe and vntrue. For firſt, <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> were learned men, aſwell as <hi>Luther,</hi> and taught truth before they knew him. <hi>Carolſtadius</hi> alſo taught matters neuer learned of him. Secondly, except in the expoſition of the words of the Lords ſupper, in which the Papiſts do differ more then any others, all conſented with <hi>Luther</hi> in moſt things, and in this did modeſtly diſſent from him. Thirdly, thoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined different opinions among them that diſſallow the reall preſence cannot be proued. Let <hi>Parſons</hi> ſhew, where they are now maintained, and by whom. <hi>4.</hi> It is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that <hi>Luther</hi> taught alwayes contrary to the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, as his writings ſhew. <hi>5.</hi> It cannot be ſhewed, that either <hi>Melancthon</hi> condemned <hi>Illyricus,</hi> or contrariwiſe. <hi>6. Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> had their doctrine from the Apoſtles, and not from <hi>Zuinglius. 7. Seruetus</hi> was a Spaniard, and a Papiſt, and an heretike, and no collegue of <hi>Caluin.</hi> Nay by his meanes his hereſies were firſt detected and refuted, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:18556:161"/> he puniſhed. <hi>8.</hi> It is ridiculous to ſay, that we admit no Iudge, and laugh at generall Councels. For we eſteeme them highly, and admit the cenſure of any iudge procéeding by the canon of ſcriptures. <hi>9.</hi> The condemnation of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> in a ſynode, is a méere fiction. The <hi>10.</hi> lye is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by <hi>Lauater</hi> and <hi>Sleidan. Sleidan</hi> ſaith, they agréed at <hi>Marpurge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>That ſeeing they conſented in the chiefe points, after that they ſhould abſteine from all contention. <hi>Quando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem in praecipuis omnibus dogmatis idem ſentirent, abſtinendum eſſe deinceps ab omni contentione.</hi>
                     </hi> The <hi>11.</hi> lie is refuted by <hi>Melancthons</hi> whole workes: where it is not found, that euer he called his brethren heretikes, or went about to proue them ſo. Nay, his principall ſtudy was vnitie and peace. <hi>12. Zuinglius</hi> died accompanying his countrimen of <hi>Zuricke</hi> in the battel againſt other <hi>Cantons</hi> of Suizzerland: and ſtanding for his country, not againſt his countrey. <hi>13. Oecolampadius</hi> died in peace, neither did <hi>Luther</hi> euer write of him, that which the Papiſts haue reported. <hi>14.</hi> The names of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians</hi> we haue deteſted: and if any contention were betwixt thoſe, that fauoured <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> yet was it rather priuat then publike. <hi>15.</hi> Our religion we claime from the Apoſtles, and not from <hi>Luther,</hi> and ſo do other reformed Churches. <hi>16. Stankare</hi> we condemne, as an heretike. <hi>17.</hi> The letter ſuppoſed to be written by <hi>Chemnitius</hi> againſt the Quéene, is too ridiculous to procéed from him. The ſame doth rather ſauour of the blackeſmiths forge of papiſts. <hi>18.</hi> In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> there are no publike contentions; nor do priuate men, ſuch ſpecially as are reputed among vs as brethren, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about matters of ſaluation. As for thoſe contentions, that haue bene about ceremonies, they by the kings wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are ended, to the great griefe of <hi>Parſons,</hi> and other enemies of our peace. Wherefore vnleſſe <hi>Parſons</hi> can bring better proofes then <hi>Reſcius, Stancarus, Staphylus,</hi> and ſuch like barking curres of his owne kennell; both he and they will be taken for wicked and ſhameleſſe forgers of lyes and ſlanders.</p>

                  <p>Hauing belyed vs before, in the ſeuenth chapter of his firſt encounter he telleth lies alſo of himſelfe, and of his owne conſorts. Firſt he ſaith, If Papiſts <hi>were idolaters, that this error was vniuerſally receiued among them.</hi> But that followeth not. For all Papiſts haue not one opinion of Saints, of relikes, of images of Saints. The ſecond, <hi>Nicene</hi> councell denieth, <hi>That Latria is due to images, or that the images of the godhead are to be made by Chriſtians.</hi> Some hold, that not the image, but the thing ſignified is to be worſhipped: many hold contrary. All giue not diuine worſhip to the croſſe, nor pray to it in one ſort. Finally, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his bookes, <hi>de imaginibus,</hi> and <hi>de Sanctis,</hi> doth confeſſe, that there are many different opinions among the worſhippers of images. Secondly, <hi>Parſons</hi> denyeth, that Papiſts <hi>are idolaters.</hi> But <hi>Lactantius lib. <hi>1.</hi> inſtit. diuin. c. <hi>19.</hi>
                     </hi> and other fathers ſhew, that all are idolaters, that giue the worſhip of God to creatures, as the Papiſts do, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſacrament, the croſſe, and images of the Trinitie with diuine worſhip. This point is alſo fully proued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts in my laſt challenge, chap. <hi>5.</hi> Thirdly, he ſayth moſt falſly, <hi>That all Friers and Monkes profeſſed one faith without any difference in any one article of beliefe.</hi> The falſhood of his aſſertion I haue ſhewed by diuerſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances heretofore. Fourthly, he ſayth, <hi>The Papiſts may haue a miniſteriall head of the Church, as well as we haue a woman for the head.</hi> But it is a greater matter to be head of the vniuerſall Church, then of one Realme. Againe, we call the King ſupreme gouernour, for no other cauſe, then for that he is the chiefe man of his Realme, and chiefe diſpoſer of externall matters. But they giue one conſiſtory to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Pope. Furthermore, in matters of faith, we ſay, all princes ought to ſubmit themſelues to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and their doctrine. The Pope will be equall to them, if not aboue them, and determine matters of faith, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, as <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Finally, he ſayth, <hi>Difference of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites or particular manner of life breaketh not vnitie of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> But the Apoſtle reproueth thoſe, that ſayd, <hi>I hold of

                     </hi> And <hi>Hierome</hi> ſayth, <hi>If you ſhall heare at any time thoſe which are called Chriſtians, to take their names of any but our Lord Ieſus, as for example, the <hi>Marcioniſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Valentinians,</hi> know that they are not the Church of Chriſt, but the ſynagogue of Antichriſt.</hi> This therefore is direct againſt the <hi>Dominicans, Franciſcans, Benedictines</hi> and <hi>Ignatians.</hi> And proueth, <hi>Ignatian Parſons,</hi> a lying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>66.</hi> b. he ſaith, <hi>That in S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> time the Romaine faith was accompted the generall Catholike faith.</hi> And <hi>that this Iſland hath had twiſe participation of the Romaine faith.</hi> Both manifeſt lyes. For as well might the city of <hi>Rome</hi> be called the world, as the Romaine faith, the <hi>generall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike ſaith.</hi> Againe, it is falſe, that in old time we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Romaine faith, that now is profeſſed and declared in the conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi> For we receiued the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> faith, which not theſe <hi>Romaines,</hi> that are a collection of the ſcumme of the world, but the old generouſe Romaines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>69.</hi> he denyeth, that the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers ſhould be in a knowne language:</hi> where boldly he giueth the lye to <hi>Ambroſe, Chryſoſtome, Theophylact,</hi> and other fathers, that ſhew, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of publike prayers, in a knowne tongue.</p>
                  <p>To iuſtifie the vſe of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue in reading of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he maketh two loud lyes, as I muſt néedes tell him in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Firſt he ſaith, <hi>That Ioan Bourcher by reading ſcriptures in Engliſh, learned that Chriſt had not taken fleſh of his mother, and that a tanner of Colcheſter learned, that Baptiſme was worth nothing,</hi> and that <hi>others fell into here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies by reading ſcriptures.</hi> And <hi>ſecondly, That euery man light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtandeth ſomewhat of the Latin tongue.</hi> Both vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vntrue. For neither do the vulgar people among the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Italians</hi> vnderſtand Latin: nor do Chriſtians ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now fall into error by reading vulgar ſcriptures, then the old Gréekes and Romaines, that read ſcriptures in Greeke and Latin. But rather therefore did they erre, for
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:18556:162"/> that they did not reade them diligently or reuerently.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>71.</hi> he ſaith <hi>we teach that good workes are perilous.</hi> Let him therefore name thoſe which haue committed this fault, or elſe acknowledge himſelfe to be a perilous lyer.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>79.</hi> he cannot be content to lie, where he talketh of matter of charge, but will néeds haue me teſtifie matters which I neuer thought. I might as well make him ſpeake all villany againſt the Pope: but I wilt not now vſe the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of ſo bad a fellow.</p>
                  <p>That which he telleth of the Popes exactions <hi>out of great benefices onely,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Encon. 1. c. 11</note> 
                     <hi>and of his employments of mony againſt the Turkes</hi> are méere leaſings. For he taketh by one meanes or other both of great and litle, and rather deſtroyeth Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans then <hi>Turkes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>89.</hi> he exclaimeth and ſayth, <hi>What will you ſay to this man, that maketh all his aunceſtors for ſo many hundred yeares together, and the aunceſtors of her Maieſtie, her father, and grandfather, and the reſt meere infidels?</hi> I anſwer in his owne forme. What will you ſay to this beaſt, that lieth as faſt as a dog can trot? My words that he ſetteth downe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him. For I ſpeake not of all, but of the moſt part of Chriſtians of former times: and of their ignorance I haue brought ſufficient proofe. If then thoſe that lie, <hi>deſerue cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelling,</hi> as he ſaith: it is not halfe a loade of wood that will ſerue for the baſtonading of this brutiſh and ſenſeleſſe beaſt.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>99. By which words it is euident</hi> (ſaith <hi>Parſons) that his rule conſiſteth of the conſent and eſtabliſhment of certain men in England, what to beleeue, which is a different matter from ſcriptures.</hi> But whatſoeuer he thinketh of the rule of faith, he kéepeth no rule in ſpeaking vntruth. For albeit the rule of faith, which euery priuate man in <hi>England</hi> is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, was eſtabliſhed by conſent of the ſynode of the Clergy of <hi>England:</hi> yet I ſay not, nor doth it follow of theſe words, that the conſent of men is our rule of faith. For the canon of ſcriptures is the generall rule, that all the Church ought to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:18556:163"/> follow, and becauſe euery priuate man vnderſtandeth not all points of himſelfe, therefore the Church, to helpe the weakneſſe of the ignorant, hath gathered the ſumme of faith out of ſcriptures, and propoſed the ſame as concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thence deduced for priuate men to follow.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>105.</hi> like a ſhameleſſe beaſt he ſayth, <hi>The Emperours</hi> (in the <hi>l. cunctos. Cod. de ſum. Trin. &amp; fid.

                     </hi> both which aſſertions are matters vtterly falſe. For firſt they remit men, not to the Romane faith, or to <hi>Damaſus</hi> his beléefe, but to the faith of <hi>Peter.</hi> Next they determine, that men ſhall follow that faith, and declare what the faith is. <hi>Cunctos populos</hi> (ſay they) <hi>quos clementiae noſtrae regit imperium, in tali volumus religione verſari, quam diuum Petrum Apoſtolum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didiſſe Romanis religio vſque adhuc ab ipſo inſinuata declarat, quam<expan>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſame leafe he telleth alſo many other groſſe lies: as for example, <hi>That the Romane religion was receiued by <hi>Peter:</hi>
                     </hi> whereas the Emperours in the former law, ſay, <hi>that <hi>Peter</hi> deliuered Chriſtian religion to the Romanes.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the Emperors law declareth <hi>the Pope of Rome to be the chiefe gouernor of Chriſtian religion,</hi> and that <hi>the Emperours accompted him for their head.</hi> And thirdly, <hi>that Silueſter confirmed the decrees of the Councel of Nice.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters moſt ſottiſh, and bluntly and falſly affirmed.

                  </p>
                  <p>In his ſecond encounter chap. <hi>2.</hi> it ſéemeth he hath put on
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:18556:163"/> his vizour of impudency, telling lies vpon reports without all ſhame or proofe. In King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his dayes, he ſaith, <hi>that a certaine Catholike man in Louth in Lincolnſhire was put to death, being baited in a beares ſkin,</hi> and that <hi>the ſame thereof is yet freſh in Louth.</hi> Matters very falſe, as all the old men in Louth wil teſtifie vpon their othes. Further the ſame is ſo improbable, as nothing more. For neither can the partie that was ſo put to death, nor the iudges, or executioners, or parties preſent be named. Nay it cannot be proued, that any was put to death at <hi>Louth</hi> at that time: albeit ſome of <hi>Louth</hi> were in danger for the rebellion, as is yet remembred. <hi>Parſons</hi> alſo muſt tell, how any durſt put men to death contrary to law, &amp; who they were, knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the very rebels were not executed without trial.

Secondly, if they had not bene Papiſts, they would neuer haue fled to the Pope for reformation, nor giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſuch reuerent termes as they do.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:18556:166"/> to empoyſon Quéene <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and of <hi>Holt</hi> that did the like to <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Williams,</hi> that vndertooke to murder her, and by diuers like facts of others. The ſecond is refuted by the memorials of the league, by the author of the Iebuſits Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thechiſme, and by <hi>Iohn de Serres</hi> in his Inuentorie. In the memorials of the league, we find that the yong friar was induced by the Ieſuites perſwaſions. <hi>Ne furent ils complices</hi> (ſaith the author of the Iebuſites Catechiſme, page <hi>203.) <hi>d'auec le Iacobin de l aſſaſſinat du feu roy?</hi> Were not they</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of the Iebuſites) <hi>complices to the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can frier that murdred the late King?</hi> He ſaith alſo, <hi>that the murder was ſuborned by the Iebuſites and leaguers,</hi> and <hi>that he was drawne to it by promiſes of paradiſe,</hi> and that he was aſſoyled for it, and almoſt ſainted beforehand. <hi>Iohn de Serres</hi> in his Inuentorie ſayth, <hi>That <hi>Iames Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> communicated his reſolution with Doctour <hi>Bourgoin</hi> prior of his conuent, to <hi>Commolet</hi> and other Iebuſites, and the heads of the league, to the principall of the ſixteene, and fortie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that all encouraged him to this happie aduenture, promiſing him rewards in earth, and in paradiſe, if he ſhould be martyred in the execution of his purpoſe, a place aboue the Apoſtles. <hi>Ainſi reſolu</hi>
                     </hi> (ſayth <hi>Iohn de Serres) <hi>il communique ſon affaire au doctour Bourgoin prieur de ſon conuent, au pere Commolet, &amp; autres Ieſuites, aux chefs de la ligue, aux principaux de ſeize &amp; de quarante de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.

                     </hi> May we not then rightly conclude, that <hi>Parſons</hi> is a notorious and moſt impudent lyar, and that the Iebuſites are King-killers and notorious traitors? No queſtion.

                     </hi> And in the beginning of his third booke againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> he ſheweth, that it is Pelagianiſme to affirme, <hi>That after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, Chriſtians haue no ſinne, and if they are without ſinne, that they are iuſt, and when they are once iuſt, if they worke carefully, that they may perſeuere in iuſtice, and eſchew all ſinne.</hi> In my laſt challenge alſo, I haue ſhewed by diuers other authorities and arguments, that the Papiſts are flat Pelagians, &amp; true Puritans. Hoping that <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> will hereafter the rather forbeare to talke of puritans, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe being an impure puritan, and Iebuſites being nothing elſe, but right puritan Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame place he ſayth, <hi>My volume is more intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and malignant,</hi> then that of <hi>Sir Francis:</hi> rayling fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſt, as his faſhion is, vpon him, that is next his hand. But what if my booke be more temperate, then his <hi>Wardword?</hi> Will he yet ſtill call it <hi>Intemperate,</hi> calling his <hi>Wardword</hi> temperate? This therefore by indifferent men is to be iudged, and not by ſuch an intemperat malignant mate. Againe, ſéeing I diſpute againſt the malignant rable of Antichriſt, &amp; againſt <hi>Parſons</hi> and ſuch like malicious rake-hels that ſéeke to bring their countrey into bondage vnder the Pope and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he hath no reaſon to talke of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, being himſelfe eſpecially a malignant traytour.</p>
                  <p>In the anſwere to my Epiſtle, he calleth me <hi>contentious miniſter,</hi> and afterward, <hi>formall noddy.</hi> But if it be lawfull for him to ſtriue againſt his countrey, and againſt religion, he muſt giue me leaue to contend for my countrey againſt traytors, and for truth againſt falſhood. We ought all <hi>to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:18556:168"/> contend to pleaſe God,</hi> as the Apoſtle did, <hi>2. Cor. 5.</hi> and not to pleaſe Antichriſt. Furthermore, ſeeing the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diſdaineth not to be called <hi>a Miniſter of Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> this ſquib Frier,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. &amp;. 1.

As for the title of <hi>formall Noddy,</hi> I doubt not but to remoue it from my ſelfe to him. His materiall and groſſe foolery is ſo palpable, that if Cardinals had bene choſen of formall Noddies, he could not haue miſſed the Cardinals hat with an appendix of a coxcombe and a bell.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame place, poſſeſſed with a pang of rayling he calleth me <hi>Terentian Thraſo,</hi> and <hi>Philiſtian Goliah.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe words did not anſwere his ſwelling conceit, he addeth <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> and ſaith, I challenge like a giant. But all his bombaſted words will not make me ſwell ſo big, as Toadlike <hi>Parſons</hi> with his barrel belly, who albeit, he hath ſometimes playd <hi>Thraſo</hi> &amp; called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>Captaine Cowbucke,</hi> yet is indeed nothing, but a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baby, and the whore of <hi>Babylons Ballio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterward, he ſayth, <hi>That vnder a vizard, I play the Vize:</hi> as if Vizes in England plaid with vizards. But in Italy euery <hi>Mountbanke</hi> and <hi>Zanni</hi> playeth with a vizard. This therefore may better fit <hi>Parſons,</hi> who ſince he came into <hi>Italy,</hi> hath neuer ceaſed to play the Vize, now taking the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of <hi>Howlet,</hi> now of <hi>Philopater,</hi> and laſtly, of <hi>N.D. <hi>alias</hi>
                     </hi> a noble Dizard, deſeruing to be called Noddy and Zanni. He wanteth nothing but his boxes of drugs and ſerpents, to be a perfect mountebanke, ſtanding now in the ſtate of perfection of dizardry.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of my ſtile, he calleth it, <hi>a vaine ſtile of ſcolding and ſcurrility:</hi> belike, to preuent me, that I ſhould not obiect ſcolding and ſcurrilitie to him, that hath the ſame both by the fatherſide and motherſide, and imployeth it moſt vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the defence of the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> his ſecond whore mother.</p>
                  <p>In his obſeruations vpon <hi>Sir Francis</hi> his Epiſtle fol. <hi>6.</hi>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:18556:168"/> he toucheth him with termes of <hi>bloody Sycophancie.</hi> But he doth himſelfe and others wrong, to giue his owne orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to thoſe that litle deſerue them. For who ſo will looke into the libels ſet out by this baſtardly barking curre, he cannot chuſe but giue him the garland of <hi>Sycophancie</hi> before all his fellowes. And certes no man knoweth his plots for inuaſion, for conueying the crowne of England to ſtrangers, and other ſtratagemes, but he will rather take him to be the ſonne of a bloody butcher, then of a blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith.</p>
                  <p>He rayleth alſo againſt <hi>M. Crane, M. Sipthorpe,</hi> and <hi>M.

But compare them with his rakehell Iebuſites, and <hi>Romiſh</hi> prieſts, nay with the conſiſtoriall Cardinals, and we ſhall ſee, that he that alloweth the conſort and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of Cardinals, hath no reaſon to ſpeake againſt thoſe vertuous and learned men. Neither are the names and conditions of Romiſh prieſts ſuch, as that this euill fauored companion may deſpiſe the names of theſe men in reſpect of the other, that deſerue no fauour either for their titles or qualities.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>11.</hi> b. in his obſeruations vpon my preface, he ſaith, <hi>It is ſpiced with poyſon and venome.</hi> But all honeſt men are to like it the better, being miſliked of <hi>Parſons</hi> and his viperous conſorts,, who as they poyſon mens ſoules with falſe doctrine, ſo do they by poyſon and practiſe ſéeke to murder all, that are oppoſite to their wicked purpoſes, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the cup, ſo as Cardinal <hi>Allen,</hi> the biſhop of <hi>Caſſana,</hi>

                  <p>Fol. <hi>2.</hi> he talketh of my companions, and calleth them <hi>A rude rabble of pyraticall companions:</hi> railing at men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſeruice, that haue both by ſea and land ſerued their countrey againſt all forreine enemies, ſet on by a packe of

                  <p>Fol. <hi>26.</hi> he termeth me <hi>pedling merchant:</hi> but without all reaſon.

But percaſe he deſpiſeth all pettie pedlars, himſelfe like a <hi>mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke</hi> offering to ſell the crowne of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>Fol. <hi>39. But ho ſir ſwaſhbuckler,</hi> ſayth he, forgetting his ſwaſhing when he plaid captaine <hi>Cowbucke,</hi> and when <hi>an. <hi>1588.</hi>
                     </hi> he was ſwaſhing and ſwaggering among the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, that he meant to bring to cut his own countrimens throates.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>41.</hi> he raileth like a lunatike friar, and fol. <hi>58.</hi> and in other places calleth me <hi>Oedipus,</hi> himſelfe playing <hi>Dauus,</hi> and like a daw cackling at euery one that commeth in his way.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>97.</hi> b. where I ſay, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the doctrine of Chriſt Ieſus, according to the rule that was eſtabliſhed by common conſent; and that they that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe from this rule are not to be accounted of our ſocietie. <hi>Marke</hi> (ſayth <hi>Parſons) the giddy head of this gagling gooſe.</hi> But what aileth this frantike felow thus to raile?

As for me, I ſpeake of <hi>Luthers</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as ſome groſſely vnderſtand it, and not as it may be vnderſtood, his words being fauorably conſtrued. <hi>Parſons</hi> therfore for this cauſe had no reaſon to raile and ſcold in his mothers language. But if he would haue railed, yet it ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not well for baſtards, and barking hel-hounds, and proud peacockes, to obiect either baſtardy, or barking, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy to others.</p>

                  <p>Encounter <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi> he calleth me <hi>whirleheaded Miniſter,</hi> and ſaith my reaſons are circular. But the errour was in the whirling head of this quadra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gular or rather foure elbowed ſot. For I do not remit men from Chriſt to the Scriptures, nor from ſcriptures to interpreters, nor backe againe as he ſuppoſeth, turning like a dizard in a morice dance: but ſay that the doctrine of Chriſt concerning ſaluation is apparant
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:18556:170"/> in Scriptures, and there I would haue all to reſt. Albeit for vnderſtanding ſcriptures, we are to vſe all ordinary means of ſtudie, tongues, conference of places, interpreters, praier, and the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>104.</hi> he chargeth me with <hi>malepart ſaucineſſe,</hi> and calleth me <hi>prating Miniſter,</hi> and that onely becauſe I am bold to reproue the Pope and his conſorts for their murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and empoyſoning of Princes, for their diſloyaltie and rebellion againſt Magiſtrates, and for troubling the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world for the maintenance of their pompe and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. But if they wil not ceaſe to do leudly, they muſt not thinke much to heare their leudneſſe diſciphred. The world crieth ſhame againſt their empoiſonments, aſſaſſinous murders, rebellions, trecheries and villanies, and if we ſhould not, the ſtones would proclaime their wickedneſſe. Let this hackſter therefore hold his pratling, and forbeare his ſaucy cenſures, or elſe in my next he ſhall heare of more of their trecheries.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>116. 2.</hi> enc. c. <hi>14.</hi> he talketh idly <hi>of filthy and licentious life, of pyracie, of buying &amp; ſelling of benefices, of ruffians and rauinous companions,</hi> and I know not what, railing like a ſcolding queane, and running vpon vs like a mad dog with open mouth. Further, it appeareth he hath ſold himſelfe as a ſlaue to Antichriſt, for the defence of al his abominations. But ſéeing he was determined to giue his tongue the reins to all ſcurrilitie; common reaſon me thinkes might teach him two things: firſt, not to raile without all ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and proofe: and next, not to obiect to innocent men ſuch crimes, as himſelfe and his conſorts are guiltie of. If he will not learne of others, yet ſhall he find that I obiect nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treaſon, nor libelling, nor théeuery, nor lechery, nor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinage, nor villany, nor knauery to him, but I proue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame either by his owne trecherous writings, or by the actes of <hi>Bailiol</hi> colledge, or by the teſtimonie of the ſecular prieſts his conſorts, or other good euidence and preſumption.

                  <p>Fol. <hi>8.</hi> he crieth out <hi>of two apparant abuſes, calumniation, and flattery.</hi> And why? Forſooth becauſe <hi>Parſons</hi> is accuſed to reioyce that her Maieſties yeares grow on ſo faſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Sir Francis</hi> doth pray for the prolongation of her daies to the holding out ſtill of the Popes authoritie. As if it were flattery to pray for her Maieſties long life, and not lawfull ſo to do. Or elſe, as if all the world knew not that <hi>Parſons</hi> by publiſhing <hi>Sanders <hi>de ſchiſmate,</hi>
                     </hi> and diuers libels hath ſought her diſgrace, and both by warres and treaſons to the vttermoſt of his power procured her deſtruction. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith <hi>Parſons) it may be preſumed that the Eſſexian aſſault would haue abbreuiated this ſtill.</hi> Where I pray you note, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſlaunder of this noble Earle, he confeſſeth, that if that action had taken effect, the Popes authoritie would not haue bene ſtill holden out. By which it may appeare, that by the trechery of ſome hollow hearted Papiſts, this noble Earle was brought to deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>9.</hi> moſt impudently he affirmeth, that nothing is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to his diſcourſe of <hi>Emoluments of tolleration of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh religion,</hi> and of the <hi>hurts that haue come of alteration of religion.</hi> As if popiſh religion being proued falſe, idolatrous and diſaſtrous to all kingdomes, all his diſcourſe did not fal to the ground. But this is the faſhion of ſuch combatants, to crie victorie when they are beaten out of the field. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he crieth out <hi>manifeſt vntruths,</hi> becauſe <hi>Sir Francis</hi> ſaith, <hi>he was firſt called into the field by Parſons.</hi> But as wel may the théefe ſay, that the peaceable traueller that giueth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all to beware of théeues, prouoked the théefe to ſet vpon him. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ready to come for <hi>England. Sir Francis</hi> giueth the alarme.

                  <p>Fol. <hi>11.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>my Preface tendeth wholy to bloodſhed.</hi> But this grieuous accuſation required ſome more proofe then he bringeth. Notwithſtanding let vs heare what he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth.

                     <hi>His firſt perſwaſion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is by extolling excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly her Maieſties extraordinary clemencie.</hi> As if the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a Princes clemencie were a perſwaſion to crueltie. Or as if <hi>Parſons</hi> commending Pope <hi>Clements</hi> clemencie, perſwaded him to rigour. Who euer heard ſuch a witleſſe ſpeake? Another reaſon he imagineth me to haue drawne from the meanings of papiſts. But like an vnſkilful archer, he neither hitteth my reaſon nor intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He is therfore to learne, that my purpoſe was to arme her Maieſty againſt <hi>Parſons</hi> and his conſorts treaſons: and rather to ſecure the State, then to vſe violence to any, but ſuch as by all means oppugned the State, and ſought by trechery to vndermine the State.</p>
                  <p>Where I ſhew that heretikes,<note place="margin">Fol. 14.</note> idolaters &amp; traitors are to be puniſhed, &amp; therfore factious papiſts: he ſaith, <hi>thus to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at rando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is much like to boies argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting in ſophiſtry.</hi> And yet he with all his logick ſhal neuer anſwer this argument, conſidering that I haue proued <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts to be heretikes, idolaters, and traitors.<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Nay <hi>W.

                  <p>In the ſame place he noteth, as he ſayth, a contradiction betwixt <hi>Sir Francis</hi> and me. But the contradiction was in his vnderſtanding, and not betwéen vs. For neither would I, nor he haue ſimple Papiſts puniſhed with death: which is the opinion of <hi>S.

                  <p>Fol. <hi>32.</hi> he triumpheth as if <hi>Sir Francis</hi> had yeelded in the matter of controuerſy concerning the bleſſings of this land, where he confeſſeth, <hi>that the life of religion, Queene, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is at the ſtake.</hi> He ſayth alſo, <hi>that the example of <hi>Ioſias</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth an euill abodement towards her Maieſties perſon.</hi> But vnleſſe his arguments were better, he ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a vaine man to mount ſo high vpon ſo ſmal aduantage, and to enter into his triumphant chariot.

The conſequent is moſt true, and neceſſary. For that which is done by theſe bloodthirſtie wolues, is not to be imputed to vs, whoſe onely labour is to reſiſt their malice. Nay it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> was cauſe of the wars of <hi>France,</hi> and the low countryes, and that he ſtirred ſedition both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> The diabolicall Iebuſites alſo were the inſtruments to ſtirre the rebellious leaguers in <hi>France,</hi> and haue alwayes done their beſt to trouble <hi>Suethland, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> The angels of <hi>Satan</hi> poſſeſſing the heads of Iebuſites and maſſe-prieſts, wrought the maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of <hi>France,</hi> and troubles of <hi>Flanders.

                  <p>Fol. <hi>90.</hi> and <hi>91.</hi> he cryeth out <hi>of lyes and impudencies.</hi> But for my part, I ſay, ſhame take him that lyeth. For firſt it is notorious, that in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, although the aduerſary would deny it, there is, and hath bene great
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:18556:176"/> variety in their liturges, as the miſſals and formularies of <hi>Toledo, Seuil, Sarum, Paris, Rome, Yorke and Millan</hi> do ſhew. Neither hath <hi>Parſons</hi> any thing to anſwere, but <hi>that in the ſubſtance of the ſacrifice they agree.</hi> As if that were all, or the moſt part of the Romiſh ſeruice: or as if I had not ſhewed that this is moſt falſe, in my bookes <hi>De Miſſa.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is true that the Conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> hath aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed diuers old miſſals and formularies, as the bull prefixed before them ſhew. Thirdly, it is true that <hi>Iuſtine</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſe</hi> deſcribe the forme that Chriſtians vſed in their Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, as <hi>Iuſtines</hi> ſecond Apologie, and <hi>Dionyſe</hi> his bookes of Eccleſiaſticall hierarchie teſtifie. Fourthly, the inſtruction of the <hi>Armenians</hi> was no act of the Conuenticle of <hi>Florence,</hi> but of ſome odde Maſſe-prieſt that vſed that conuenticles name. It is no lie therefore, notwithſtanding this inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Conuenticle of <hi>Florence</hi> did not by any canon eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſeuen ſacraments. Fifthly, the Conuenticle of <hi>Lateran</hi> vnder <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, doth mention penance, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the name of ſacrament, as I ſayd moſt truly, to <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Finally it is moſt true, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſacrifice of the Maſſe was not knowne of the auncient fathers: and I haue proued it in my third booke <hi>De Miſſa</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Which if <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> confute, I ſhall be content that the Pope beſtow on him a Cardinals hat. But if he be not able to anſwer, and yet will néedes cry out <hi>famous falſhood,</hi> I will beſtow on him a pointed cap with a bell, and a capons feather, to let all the world know, that at that houſe dwelleth a ſot. <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus,</hi> &amp; other fathers that he doth mention, ſpeake not of the body and bloud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offered in the Maſſe, but of an oblation made in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of that ſacrifice. Our writers, albeit they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the fathers in ſome things, yet no where do they yéeld, that they ſpeake of the popiſh ſacrifice of the Maſſe, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered after the damnable faſhion of the ſynagogue of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>107.</hi> he calleth <hi>for two reall differences betweene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in the points of faith.</hi> And therefore I count my ſelfe
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:18556:176"/> bound to ſhew him not two onely, but many more. It may pleaſe him therefore to reade what I haue ſayd before, and to anſwere to euery point particularly: and then I hope he will ceaſe his harſh and curriſh bawling. He muſt alſo ſhew, that his conſorts differ not in matters of moment, or in any thing, if he will defend their vnion.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>111.</hi> he crieth out, and in his dogges voyce ſayth, <hi>If this woodcocke, or any of his crew can ſhew any one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, as an article of faith in our religion, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>If O. E. or his mates can ſhew any one hereſie, taken for an hereſie by the generall Church.</hi> What then? forſooth he ſaith, <hi>He will yeeld in the reſt.</hi> Which I would pray him to remember. For if I do not make him in this poynt a foote length of noſe like a Curliew, let the Pope, if it be his pleaſure, make him king of the Canaries. Nay I haue already ſhewed diuers both nouelties and hereſies to be contained in Popiſh religion, and no Popiſh woodcocke yet hath thruſt out his beake to anſwere, ſhewing themſelues by their wits to be woodcockes, and by their ſilence Codfiſh. Onely one woodcocke of <hi>Rome</hi> vnder the maſke of <hi>W. R. <hi>aliàs</hi> Walphoole,</hi> or wicked <hi>Richard</hi> fluſheth forth with his long bill. But his anſwere is ſuch as confirmeth my chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge very much: the man being not able to anſwere any one argument. <hi>Parſons</hi> alſo toucheth the hereſie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians,</hi> which among many other, I obiected to him, and anſwereth, <hi>that Papiſts differ from Collyridians manifeſtly.</hi> But it is not inough to ſhew a difference, vnleſſe he alſo ſhew, that his conſorts hold no one point condemned as hereſie in the <hi>Collyridians.</hi> But that the congerhead can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do. For like to the <hi>Collyridians</hi> they pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and offer in her honour. This anſwere therefore ſheweth him to be of the lignage of woodcockes. But of theſe matters we ſhall talke elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>In his <hi>2.</hi> enconter c. <hi>2.</hi> he cryeth out, <hi>ô cogging, ô cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinage:</hi> and all becauſe <hi>Sir Francis</hi> reporteth, that the blood of a Ducke was worſhipped, as the blood of Hales, and that <hi>D. Baſſinet</hi> confeſſed his ignorance, and that the archbiſhop
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:18556:177"/> of <hi>Aix</hi> called the Pope <hi>God on earth,</hi> and ſpoke fooliſhly. But what if all this were true? May not we then with more reaſon ſay, O coggers, O coſiners, O Scogans, O cods-heads! But that appeareth plainly. For the impoſture about the duckes blood was openly detected, and the reſt is reported in the acts of <hi>Baſſinets</hi> examination. Neither is it vnlikely, that vnlearned prelates ſhould ſpeake vnlearned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or that ſchoole-doctors ſhould be ignorant in ſcriptures, ſéeing all their diuinity is grounded vpon <hi>Thomas</hi> his far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of queſtions and anſwers. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith <hi>Parſons, how could a duckes blood be diſcerned from others blood after ſo many yeares?</hi> As if it were not detected alſo by the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the falſe prieſts, that from time to time they renewed that blood, as they do other falſe relikes in many places. Here therefore <hi>Parſons</hi> ſheweth himſelfe to haue a ſhallow capacitie: and the Papiſts are declared to be miſerably ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by cogging and couſening prieſts, and caried away moſt ſimply and idiot like to the worſhip of idoles and falſe reliques.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>43.</hi> b. of his ſecond encounter he cryeth out, <hi>Who ſhall be iudge?</hi> Meaning to conuey the higheſt authoritie in iudgement, concerning matters of controuerſie about the interpretation of ſcriptures, to the Pope. But that is a ſhameleſſe and moſt abſurd courſe, to place a beetleheaded, ignorant and impious Pope aboue al learned holy fathers, and Councels. Beſide that, the Popes ſentence is alwayes vncertaine.

                  <p>Fol. <hi>118. 2.</hi> encontr. ch. <hi>15.</hi> where we ſay that king <hi>Iohn</hi> was poyſoned by a Monke of <hi>Swineſtead</hi> Abbey, and that the Monke was before hand abſolued of his Abbot: he cryeth out, that this <hi>example is more groſſe and abſurd then the former,</hi> viz. of king <hi>Henry the 3. of France.</hi> But in the former example we haue ſhewed, that there is no other groſſeneſſe, or abſurditie, but that ſuch a wicked ſect as the Iebuſites, ſhould be permitted to liue on the face of the earth, vnder the protection of Chriſtian kings, ſéeing they ſéeke to murder all of them, that are excommunicate by the Pope. The hiſtory which we report of <hi>king Iohn</hi> is neither abſurd, conſidering the hatred of the ſwiniſh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of polſhorne prieſts, nor vntrue. <hi>Caxtons</hi> Chronicle ſayth, he dyed of poyſon giuen him by a Monke. <hi>Polychro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon lib. 7. c. 33.</hi> and <hi>Polydore virgil</hi> deny not, but that this was a common ſpeech. Thoſe that mention not poyſon, ſay that he dyed of a ſurfeit. Now who knoweth not, that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits and poyſon haue often the ſame ſymptomes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects? The abſolution giuen him is proued by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practiſe in thoſe caſes. As for the allegations made to the contrary, they are like <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> that is, abſurd and ridiculous. <hi>Polydore</hi> (ſaith <hi>Parſons</hi>) affirmeth, that he dyed of heauineſſe of heart. <hi>Radulphus Niger,</hi> that he dyed of ſurfeting. <hi>Roger Houeden,</hi> that he dyed of a bloody flixe. But all this doeth rather increaſe the ſuſpition of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then otherwiſe. <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> is a poore author, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring as much of Popery, as of his preſſing yron and Taylery. What then if he ſhould endeuour to cleare an old ſuſpition, that maketh againſt Papiſts? Much leſſe then ſhould <hi>Parſons</hi> ſtand vp on his teſtimony, if he name nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:18556:178"/> Monke nor poyſon. Monkes and Papiſts ordinarily ſuppreſſe all things, that tend to the diſgrace of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and more credit is to be giuen to one or two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes affirming a truth againſt their will, then to twenty lying Monkes or Friers, or pelting Popiſh writers, that write for affection, rather then for truth.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, albeit he crye loud,<note place="margin">Iohn. 19.</note> as the Iewes did againſt <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and ſtand much vpon his ſtout arguments and obiections, as Sophiſters vſe to do; yet nothing is more vaine, then his clamours and outcryes, nor more feeble then his obiections. <hi>Nazianzen epiſt. <hi>31.</hi>

                  <p>In my Preface to the reader, I ſay, that obſtinate recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:18556:180"/> are for the moſt part reconciled to the Pope, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to forreine enemies: and yet notwithſtanding doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy their lands and goods. And gladly would <hi>Ro. Parſons</hi> anſwere ſomewhat. But neither can he deny, that they are reconciled (for then the maſſe-prieſts would not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them) nor that they adhere to forreine enemies (for then in vaine ſhould the <hi>Adelantado</hi> preſume of their helpe in his proclamation penned as it ſéemeth by Engliſh traytors) nor can he deny, they inioy lands and goods. For that is notorious. What then doth he? Forſooth he talketh idlely of the <hi>enioying of my benefices,</hi> and of the teſtimonie of certaine maſſe-prieſts. Of the which two, the firſt is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. The ſecond is leudly reiected without colour, ſéeing euery mans confeſſion is ſtrong againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and theſe mens confeſſions being in record, are not lightly to be refuſed. In the ſame place I ſay, that <hi>Parſons</hi> defendeth publike enemies and traytors, and ſeeketh the diſgrace of the country and nation. To all which he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing, but by telling a tale of proſecuting Papiſts, which he termeth Catholikes. As if ſuch may play the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ioyne with publike enemies openly and lawfully.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts being charged for mainteining the words of <hi>Hoſtienſis and Panormitane,</hi> that ſay, <hi>That the Pope is able to do almoſt all things, which Chriſt can do, except ſinne:</hi> he thinketh to ſhift off the matter by ſpeaking with <hi>Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fol. 29 b.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Pope can do al things with the keye of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that erreth not.</hi> But this is nothing els, but to preſume, that the Pope hath diſcretion, and the keyes of the Church; and that in the determination of matters of faith he cannot erre: whereas all the world ſeeth, that the Pope cometh into the Church not with keyes, but with pickelockes, and yron barres: and that he doth not ſo much vſe the keyes, as ſwords and clubs; and that alſo without diſcretion or reaſon, killing all that ſpeake againſt his triple crowne.</p>

                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:18556:180"/> and of the Emperour, <hi>that haue not renounced their obedience to their Princes.</hi> But his ſhift is moſt ridiculous. For the Pope was enemy to the Quéene of <hi>England,</hi> and not to them. But if at any time the Pope happen to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any of theſe Princes; then is it cleare, that ſuch ſubiects as follow the Pope, cannot by any meanes adhere to their lawfull Princes. Vnleſſe <hi>Parſons</hi> can ſhew, how a man can pleaſe two contrary maſters, and can himſelfe ſerue both God and the deuill.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>28.</hi> and <hi>29.</hi> he runneth out into a large expoſition of theſe words of <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> and <hi>Panormitan: <hi>Quod Papa poteſt quaſi omnia facere quae Chriſtus, excepto peccato:</hi>
                     </hi> but all to no purpoſe. For he ſhould ſhew, that theſe fellowes do not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pope, and not tell vs a tale of their fooleries, which as they are exorbitant, ſo are they vnpleaſant.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame place he ſayth, it is no more adſurditie to ſay, <hi>That the Pope can do almoſt all that Chriſt can, except ſinne: then if a man ſhold ſay, That the Viceroy of Naples can do all that the king of Spaine can do in that kingdome, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept being free from treaſon.</hi> But firſt the words of <hi>Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis</hi> and <hi>Panormitan,</hi> importing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> can ſinne, are blaſphemous; albeit they meant, that except auoyding ſinne, the Pope can do all, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> can do. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a ſimple ſhift to make the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> like to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Viceroy</hi> of Naples like the Pope, or elſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe two ſpéeches together. Finally, it is abſurd to ſay, that the Viceroy can do all things that the king of Spaine can. For he can neither moue warre, alienate the territory, nor do infinit other matters elſe. Beſide that, there is greater difference betwixt <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> that is God and man, then betwéene man and man. Here therefore <hi>Parſons</hi> talking of the Viceroy of Naples playeth the Vize, and ſheweth that he hath the Neapolitan ſcabbes in his braine.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>30.</hi> the canoniſts being charged for calling the Pope <hi>their Lord &amp; God.</hi> He anſwereth, <hi>That he cannot find it.</hi> As if it were not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, becauſe his nodyſhip cannot find it.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:18556:181"/> Or elſe, as if a Cardinals hat were not to be found in <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe <hi>Parſons</hi> could not find it. Let him therefore looke the gloſſe <hi>in c. inter nonnullos. extr. Ioan <hi>22.</hi> de verb. ſignif.</hi> And it may be, with the help of his ſpectacles and a draught of gréeke wine, he may find it. Oh, may his brother ſay, that he could as eaſily find a Cardinals hat.</p>
                  <p>Of fiue places alleaged by <hi>Sir Francis</hi> for proofe of the flattery of Popiſh paraſites, he toucheth onely two, being not able to iuſtifie either of them to be void of flattery. Three places he paſſeth ouer in ſilence; which it may pleaſe him to anſwere in his next. One ſayth, <hi>That no leſſe honor is due to the Pope then to Angels.</hi> Another, <hi>That the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours maieſtie is as much inferior to the Pope, as a creature to God.</hi> The third, <hi>That the Pope is <hi>ens ſecundae intentionis,</hi> compounded of God and man.</hi> If then he meane to anſwer; let him ſhew, how theſe ſpeeches are void either of flattery or blaſphemie, if he purpoſe to ſhew himſelfe void of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Fol. 37.</note>Where I bring examples, and inſtances of notorious flattery out of canoniſts, he ſayth, <hi>They are the ſame for the moſt part which Sir Francis brought before, and are before anſwered:</hi> matters moſt falſe, and poorely ſhifted off.

Nay of fiue that Sir <hi>Francis</hi> brought, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth onely two, and them very leudly, looſely and vnſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently; and of a doozen brought by me toucheth ſcarce two. Would not he then be turned backe with a doozen ſtripes, to turne ouer theſe doozen places? And would he not be diſcarded for a knauiſh anſwerer, that ſaith nothing to that, which I ſay of our deliuerance by the Quéene from the captiuitie of the Pope, as the Iſraelites were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the captiuitie of <hi>Iabin,</hi> and the <hi>Cananites by Deborah?</hi>

                  <p>That which I ſay of the flattery of <hi>Giffard</hi> and <hi>Parſons</hi> concerning their flattering of the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he ſlippeth ouer with a few words concerning the largeneſſe of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaes.</hi> But what maketh that for the Kings greatneſſe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:18556:181"/> he held that countrey with more aſſurance and better title? Concerning the flattery of <hi>Stapleton, Bellarmine</hi> and others, which I obiect in the <hi>10.</hi> page of my Reply, he ſaith nothing. No ape could better ſkip ouer the chaine, then <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> ſkippeth ouer all our obiections.</p>
                  <p>For maintenance of the rebellious attempts of the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers in <hi>France,</hi> and other popiſh diſloyalties againſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he telleth vs, <hi>2.</hi> encon. c. <hi>13.</hi> that <hi>when the Apoſtles prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againſt the Iewiſh magiſtrates commandement, it ſeemed to the Iewes diſloyaltie, but was not.</hi> But this is a moſt poore ſhift. For the Papiſts haue not onely preached againſt the Princes commandement, but alſo haue murdred them, and proſecuted them with armes: which the Apoſtles neuer did, or thought lawfull. Was not this Iebuſite therfore a falſe Apoſtle, to pretend the Apoſtles examples for maintenance of rebels and traitors?</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>104.</hi> he ſhifteth off this argument, <hi>The Pope is to be obeyed as Chriſt, therefore if he commaund blaſphemies:</hi> by ſaying, <hi>that it followeth not,</hi> and <hi>that this folly is no leſſe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, then if one ſhould ſay, The Neapolitans profeſſe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto their Viceroy, as to the King of <hi>Spaine, ergo</hi> he is to be obeyed if he commaund treaſons againſt the King.</hi> But his anſwer is ſo learned and wiſe, that <hi>Parſons</hi> for the ſame doth deſerue to be Vizeroy, or rather a Vize in the kingdom of fooles. For firſt no man will affirme, that the Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> cannot erre. But that is denied in Chriſts Viceroy the Pope. The caſe therefore is vnlike. Furthermore, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts will obey the Pope, if he commaund hereſie or blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, becauſe they take his iudgement to be infallible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Neapolitans will not follow their Viceroy in his rebellions. Likewiſe doeth he abſurdly ſhift off the obiection concerning the abſolute obedience required of Chriſtians by <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> He ſayth alſo, <hi>that it ſtandeth with Gods prouidence to preſerue the Church from error.</hi> As if the Pope were the Church, and not rather Antichriſt, and the enemy of Chriſt and his Church: or as if the church could not ſtand if the Pope were dead, and <hi>Parſons</hi> hanged by him to beare
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:18556:182"/> him company, and to leade him through purgatory, being not able to walke of himſelfe, being troubled with the gout.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>113. 2.</hi> encont. c. <hi>14.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That <hi>Parry</hi> in his letter to <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, diſcouered no intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enterpriſe he had in hand:</hi> and thereby would ſhift off our obiection concerning the intelligence the Pope had of his purpoſe to kill the Quéene. But his ſhift is very ſimple. For albeit he ſaid nothing, yet the letters of credit included fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome great man, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he imparted the ſecret, diſcloſed all. Now it is euident by Cardinall <hi>Comoes</hi> letter, that the Pope receiued <hi>Parries</hi> letter together with the letters of credit included. <hi>La ſantitá di N.S.</hi> (ſayth Cardinall <hi>Como) <hi>ha vedute le lettere di V.S. con la fede incluſa.</hi>
                     </hi> By this then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the Pope granting a plenary indulgence to a murderer, that went to kill an innocent Queene, was alſo a moſt execrable murderer, and no ſhepheard: a limb of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan that was a murderer from the begining, and not the head of the Church; a wolfe, and no Chriſtian Biſhop. <hi>Yea but</hi> (ſaith <hi>Parſons) this indulgence tooke effect, if <hi>Parry</hi> were contrite and confeſſed of his ſinnes.</hi> As if theſe wicked mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers did not account it an act meritorious to kill a Prince excommunicated by the Pope. So it appeareth, that in this reſpect rather he obtained this indulgence. Nay if <hi>Ch. P.</hi> ſay true, <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> was alſo acquainted with <hi>Parries</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular treaſon, ſo that this will not onely remaine as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall blot of indulgences, but alſo of the barbarous tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery both of the Pope and of his baſtardly proctor that ſet on this cutthrote to murder an innocent Lady.</p>
                  <p>Doeth it not then plainly appeare, howſoeuer cloſely <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> wold ſéeme to cary matters, that he doth confeſſe more in ſhifting and concealing, then he doth deny diſputing? <hi>Ita opertus, ac tectus incedis,</hi> (ſayth <hi>Hierom</hi> to one, <hi>epiſt. <hi>6.)</hi> vt plus confitearis tacendo, quàm renuas diſputando.</hi> This we may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay of <hi>Parſons,</hi> that his ſhifts and anſwers which he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to couer the wounds of his cauſe, do make the matter far more ſuſpicious then before.

                  <p>THe very name of an aduerſary, and often mention of controuerſies, if nothing elſe, me thinkes, might haue moued <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> to looke better to his proofes, and to haue preſumed leſſe of his begging. For albeit he be of the <hi>Ignatian</hi> ſect, and by profeſſion a mendicant friar: yet hath he no reaſon to beg of his aduerſaries, nor to take as gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, things that hang in controuerſie. Nor haue we cauſe to maintaine of almes ſuch vagarant ſturdy roging beggars, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laws iudge worthy of hanging. It may be he wil ſtand vpon termes, and ſweare like a hackſter, that he is no beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,<note place="margin">Teſtified by the ſecular prieſts in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of their treatiſes.</note> beſtowing many thouſands of crownes vpon ſpies and cutthrotes. But the truth will appeare by the ſequele of his doings.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>1.</hi> b. he accuſeth me <hi>of deportment againſt all kind of Catholike men, though neuer ſo learned, vertuous, worſhipful or honorable.</hi> But he ſhold haue proued himſelf &amp; his traito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſorts, which are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men that I do meane, to be both Catholikes, and learned, vertuous, worſhipfull and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:18556:183"/>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>7.</hi> talking of prieſts put to death in <hi>England,</hi> he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them and others <hi>ſeruants of Chriſt,</hi> and ſayth, <hi>they ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for auncient religion.</hi> But we looked for proofes, and not for bare and beggarly affirmations. For the ſeruants of Chriſt came neuer to depoſe Princes from their thrones. Nay our Sauior Chriſt ſaith plainely, that <hi>his kingdome is not of this world.</hi> But theſe Maſſeprieſts, as appeareth by records, and by their confeſſions, and the Popes faculties granted to them, came for that purpoſe. Secondly, we haue proued in our challenge, that their religion, as it differeth from the faith which we profeſſe in <hi>England,</hi> is neither Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike nor ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Laſtly, we haue there alſo declared them to be culpable of treaſon, and to haue died for that, &amp; not for their religion, though otherwiſe very louzy and beggarly vellacos, and as beggarly defended by this begging and couſining companion.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame leafe alſo he affirmeth, that Chriſt is the Maſſe-prieſts captaine and maſter, and <hi>that he aſſureth them on his honour and power, that no one haire of their head ſhall periſh.</hi> In the end he doubteth not to call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> martyrs. But to proue his matters, he alleageth neither teſtimony of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor ſentence of fathers. Nay where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romiſh Church teacheth, that no man can be certaine of his ſaluation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeciall reuelation; yet this diſciple of Antichriſt affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that Chriſt vpon his honor hath aſſured <hi>Campian, Ballard, Babington,</hi> (and I thinke <hi>Lopez</hi> too) that they ſhall not periſh. For of theſe I thinke he ſpeaketh. To ſhew them to be no martyrs, I haue alleaged diuers reaſons. Reaſon then would, that if he would haue wonne credit, he ſhould haue either anſwered our reaſons, or proued his owne cauſe by argument.</p>
                  <p>In his obſeruations vpon my Preface, and in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his book, he giueth the name of <hi>Catholikes</hi> to papiſts. And yet he knoweth that this is a maine controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs. What puniſhment then doth he deſerue, that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and wilfully wil beg, or rather ſteale that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not vnto him?</p>

                  <p>Fol. <hi>14.</hi> moſt impudently he giueth the title <hi>of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Chriſtian church,</hi> and <hi>the vniuerſall body of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> vnto papiſts, that are neither the whole church, nor part of the Church. Vnto vs he giueth the title of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, Puritanes, and Lutherans:</hi> which we renounce, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing onely the faith of Chriſt Ieſus. He doeth alſo match vs with <hi>Arrians,</hi> and other ſects, which we deteſt. But theſe are points in controuerſie to be proued.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>17.</hi> he ſayth, that <hi>the Councel of Trent was gathered by like authoritie, as that of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> was.</hi> A matter vtterly denied by vs, and not any way proued by him. Nay it is moſt abſurd to compare that reuerend ſynod aſſembled and moderated by the Emperors authority, and proceeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſcriptures, to a conuenticle of ſlaues ſworne to Antichriſt, and aſſembled by his writ, and doing all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>20.</hi> a. he ſayth, <hi>It cannot be proued that any one Pope impugned his predeceſſor in matters of faith.</hi> As if al our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were not that the later Popes do impugne and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the faith of the firſt biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> Themſelues alſo deny not, but that <hi>Agatho</hi> condemned his predeceſſor <hi>Honorius</hi> for a Monothelite. In the ſame place alſo affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <hi>that all the Popes and Biſhops of Rome from <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt to <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, held one faith:</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is as cleare, as that three and foure make ſeuen.</hi> But this ſeuen and ſeuen yeare he ſhall neuer proue that, which with a light fingar he taketh as granted, &amp; is clearely falſe. For the inſtruction giuen to the <hi>Armenians</hi> in the ſynode of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the decrees of the Conuenticle of <hi>Conſtance</hi> were neuer holden of Popes before them. Nor did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Popes beléeue the doctrine of the Conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>77.</hi> b. he taketh as granted, <hi>that a hundred haue bene put to death for being prieſts, and for being ordained to that function beyond the ſeas, and for defending the faith belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to that function: and that great numbers are dayly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, arraigned and condemned for ſtanding in their
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:18556:184"/> fathers faith, and reſiſting nouelties.</hi> Both which are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vntruths. For neither in the arraignement of prieſts or others, is any queſtion made of faith: nor is that louzy pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched religion that Papiſts hold ouer and aboue our faith, the faith of the Apoſtles or Fathers: nor are prieſts executed ſimply for being prieſts, but becauſe they come from forrein enemies, and are combined with them: which alwayes hath bene accounted treaſon.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>80.</hi> he talketh idly of ſending money out of <hi>England</hi> for defence of hereſie: for he beggeth of vs that which he ſhal neuer obtaine, that popery is religion, and true religion he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and that we maintaine hereſie.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>104.</hi> he ſayth, <hi>Our Beleefe is different from the rule of faith, receiued before throughout Chriſtendome, and that our religion hath no eccleſiaſticall authoritie for her eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, beſide the parliament:</hi> matters taken vp vpon credite by this bankerout friar, that ſhall neuer be able to proue the leaſt part of them. For we make no queſtion, but to proue againſt him that our faith is Apoſtolicall and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and the popiſh faith not, and that it hath bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed not like the louzy ſuperſtition of Papiſts, by lies, dreames, legends, and the Popes decretals, but by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets.</p>
                  <p>What almes then doth this impudent begging frier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue? forſooth a motley coate with foure elbowes, and a ſquare motly bonet in ſtead of a cardinals hat. For nothing is more odious nor fooliſh, then that any vnder faire ſhews and good termes ſhould couer euill déeds, <hi>Aſſerentes Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum</hi> (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith) <hi>ſub vocabulo Chriſti:</hi> that is, <hi>ſtriuing for Antichriſt vnder the name of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>In his anſwer to my Epiſtle, he ſaith, <hi>That albeit I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge like a giant, yet when I come to gripes, I ſhew my ſelfe one of the pooreſt and weakeſt wormes, that euer lightly hath come to combat in theſe affaires.</hi> And afterward he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that I ſhall be ſoundly beaten. But if he be the giant, and I ſo weake a creature as he giueth out, why doth he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter none of my books written againſt <hi>Bellarmine?</hi> Why doth he not ſet forth ſomewhat in Latin? Why doth he giue his railing libels written in Engliſh to be turned into latin by others? As for mine owne doings, I admire them not.

                  <p>In his obſeruations vpon <hi>Sir Francis Haſtings</hi> his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, fol. <hi>10.</hi> b. he vanteth of his heroicall actes and exploits againſt him, as if his reputation were not onely <hi>craled and ſhaken,</hi> but alſo <hi>quite ouerthrowne,</hi> and that by his terrible <hi>Warneword.</hi> Afterward he talketh vainely, as if he had not onely <hi>battered and beaten,</hi> but alſo <hi>broken and ſhiuered</hi> his credit. But it ſéemes the man when he vttered theſe great words had ſwallowed too much Greeke wine, and was in ſome diſtemper. His friends do wiſh, that he had as much ſkill in the Gréeke tongue, as he hath delight in Gréeke and Spaniſh wine, not doubting but he would then ſpeake good Gréeke. But now (God wot) his wits are wind-ſhaken with the fume of wine, and his braine diſcraſied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of his <hi>Iaponian</hi> kingdome. As for his battering, beating, breaking and ſhiuering, we do not much feare, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſhins are ſhiuered with rottenneſſe, and his wits broken with idle conceits. Onely let him take héede, that he come not forth with his wooden dagger, leaſt it be beaten about his buzzardlike coxcombe.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame obſeruations, fol. <hi>6.</hi> he will not haue any man iudge of his matters, <hi>but her Maieſties moſt honorable Counſell,</hi> to whom he remitteth himſelfe. But if he come into <hi>England,</hi> he muſt haue other iudges: and if he will write, he muſt ſubmit himſelfe to euery readers cenſure. As for the Lords of the Counſell, they are no fauorable iudges to traytors, that ſeeke to bring in forraine enemies, nor are they at leyſure, to reade ſuch paltry and confuſed pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets.</p>
                  <p>In the end of his anſwere to my Epiſtle he talketh <hi>of his exceeding gaine both in merit with God, and credit with all good men:</hi> which ſheweth, that he wanteth not onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:18556:186"/> but common reaſon. For if he had but had one graine of either, he would not haue talked thus vainely, being for his treaſons, Atheiſmes, and villanies hatefull to God and man: nay hatefull to his owne conſorts.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>20.</hi> a. he threatneth <hi>to ſhake me out of my clouts.</hi> But let him leaue of crowing before the victory, if he will not be condemned for a doctour of clouts. For ſo many holes I find in his <hi>Warneword,</hi> that all his clouts will not ſerue to mend them. No not if he ſhould péece them with the ſkarlet he ſent for, as it were, to make himſelfe Cardinals robes.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame leafe, he talketh <hi>of beating the ſturdy mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter backe and ſide,</hi> and threatneth to giue him <hi>wide blowes.</hi> But all theſe threats are nothing, but as if an ideot ſhould beat the wind with his wooden dagger. As yet he hath not tryed my ſtrength. But we haue ſéene the vttermoſt that this ſturdy bragging Frier can do, and therefore referring all to indifferent iudges, I will, to helpe him forth in his imagined triumph, wiſh him for a crowne of Laurel, a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of gooſe feathers, pointed with horſeſhooe nayles, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his noble parentage.</p>
                  <p>Fol. <hi>26.</hi> he vanteth, <hi>That he will bring euery thing to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, and perſpicuous order:</hi> being the moſt diſorderly writer, falſe packer, darke and cloudy clouter, that euer tooke pen in hand for the defence of the Prince of darkeneſſe and his darling the Pope.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the flattering and lying, as well of Parſons, as other Papiſts.</head>
                  <p>STrange it is, that <hi>Parſons</hi> and his mates ſhould accuſe others, either for flattering, or elſe for lying, whereas we are cleare of theſe faults, and they moſt guilty. But what will not impudency attempt, if words may be taken for payment? <hi>Frons meretricis facta eſt illis.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ierem. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>They haue har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened their foreheads like a whore, and will not bluſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Robert Parſons taketh vp Sir Francis,</hi> as he ſayth, fol. <hi>23. for a falſe and flattering Prophet, by theſe words of Iſay 3. My people, they that ſay thou art bleſſed, are thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thee.</hi> But firſt, the Prophet talketh of deceiuing, and not of flattering. Looke then how farre deceit differeth from flattery, ſo farre ſhot <hi>Parſons</hi> wide from the ſcope of the Prophet. Secondly, the words of the Prophet do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touch the Sodomiticall prieſts, and that filthy gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then vs. For he ſpeaketh in that place of ſuch, <hi>as
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:18556:187"/> layd open their ſinnes, as did the people of Sodome: <hi>Qui pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum ſuum quaſi Sodoma praedicauerunt.</hi>
                     </hi> Which is the caſe of the Romaniſts. For albeit the whole world cryeth ſhame vpon them for their corruptions in doctrine and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in liuing; yet with them all Sodomiticall filthineſſe is holineſſe, and all truth hereſie, and many corrupt points of doctrine, religion. Thirdly, it is no flattery for Chriſtians to commend religion, or good ſubiects to like well of good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement. Which being the caſe of <hi>Sir Francis,</hi> how is the accuſed of ſlattery? Finally, this patch hath forgotten his <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who <hi>2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 115. <hi>art.</hi> 1.</hi> doth define <hi>flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be immoderat prayſe for hope of gaine.</hi> Why then doth not the wizard conuince <hi>Sir Francis,</hi> and ſhew, that for gaine he hath falſely and immoderatly prayſed the Quéene, or ſome others, as he and his conſorts vſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and extoll the Pope, and ſuch as they like, and take to be of their faction?</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe fol. <hi>35.</hi> he chargeth me to be a famous flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. But his argument to proue it doth excuſe me. For it is no flattery, to report what <hi>Ozorius</hi> and <hi>Bizarus</hi> hath ſayd of the Quéene. Neither did they ſay more then is true, or ſpeake for hope of reward. As for my ſelfe, ſo farre am I <hi>from hope of receiuing of a good fee,</hi> (albeit <hi>Parſons</hi> obiecteth ſo much vnto me) that I looke for nothing but hatred, loſſe, and perſecution for defence of truth. <hi>Parſons</hi> himſelfe may looke for a Cardinals hat, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> haue gotten Cardinals hats for lying. But for vs here be no ſuch rewards propoſed. Vnleſſe therfore he bring better proofes, and can ſhew, that we haue prayſed the Queene aboue her deſert, &amp; that for hope of gaine, his friends wil confeſſe, that he might haue done better to haue choſen ſome fitter exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, then this falſe accuſation of flattery.</p>
                  <p>But the Papiſts for hope of gaine and preferment haue both immoderatly and immodeſtly ſet out the prayſes of the Pope and his adherentes, as infinite particulars do ſhew.

                  <p>Likewiſe it is the cuſtome of papiſts to flatter Princes, hoping thereby to allure them to defend their ſect. Some they call moſt Chriſtian, ſome Catholike, ſome great Dukes. <hi>Baronius</hi> in his Epiſtle dedicatory before his third tome of Annales, calleth <hi>King Philip</hi> the ſecond of Spaine, <hi>regum maximum, <hi>the greateſt of kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>

                     </hi> He ſayth alſo, that greater things may be ſpoken of him, then <hi>Xenophon wrote of Cyrus,</hi> and ſeemeth to compare him, or preferre him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> Likewiſe doeth he groſſely flatter the French king in his Preface before his ninth tome of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Stapleton</hi> hath giuen immoderate prayſes to <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> and <hi>Thomas More,</hi> perhaps for name ſake rather then for vertue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sanders, Riſhton</hi> and <hi>Bozius,</hi> albeit they profeſſe to write hiſtories, yet do they intend nothing more then to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance their owne fauourers, and to diſgrace their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo a great part of the argument of their lying legends, to ſet out the prayſes of Monkes, Friars and ſuch like ſuperſtitious Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe without cauſe doth he accuſe vs for lying. <hi>M. Foxe</hi> vnderſtanding his error concerning the execution of <hi>Marbecke,</hi> did correct the ſame. Yet when he ſaid <hi>Marbecke</hi> was burned at Windſor, he lied not, ſpeaking that which was to him reported, and like to be true, conſidering that the partie was condemned.</p>
                  <p>Neither doeth <hi>M. Foxe</hi> ſet downe <hi>Wickleffe</hi> or others in the Calendar, to the intent to make them martyrs (for that
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:18556:189"/> paſſed his reach) but to declare the time of their death or ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parſons</hi> doth further threaten, to ſhew out of <hi>M. Foxe,</hi> and others of our writers, infinite doctrinall lies. But he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth alwayes more then he can performe. In his ſecond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, ch. <hi>2.</hi> where he giueth out theſe brags, himſelfe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth notoriouſly. For moſt falſe it is, <hi>that either the rebels in king <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond his dayes, or elſe the friars, whom <hi>Thomas Walſingham</hi> called lyars, were <hi>Wickleffes</hi> ſchollers:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this ſhameleſſe frier affirmeth both. For <hi>Ball</hi> a Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt was a principall ring-leader of the rebels: and the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were <hi>murtherers, ſodomites and traitors,</hi> as the rebels ſaid of them. <hi>Let vs</hi> (ſayd the rebels) <hi>deſtroy theſe murtherers, and burne theſe ſodomites, and hang vp theſe traitors of the King and Realme.</hi> And this they ſayd of the friars. But <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kleffe</hi> alwayes deteſted and ſpoke both againſt ſuch abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and ſuch rebellions.</p>
                  <p>It is a common tricke alſo of Papiſts, to proue their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with lies &amp; fables. To proue tranſſubſtantiation, they make a crucifixe to ſpeake theſe words, <hi>Benè de me ſcripſiſti Thoma, <hi>Thou haſt written wel of me Thomas, when ſhal I be able to requite you for your paines?</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To proue the real preſence, they make tales of bloud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the ſacrament, and ſometimes they ſay Chriſt appeared like a litle child: which are toyes to mock children withall.</p>
                  <p>To proue purgatory, they tel vs tales of <hi>S. Patrickes</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, of ſoules complaining and crying for more maſſes, of apparitions of Angels, diuels and ſoules. The ſame lies they abuſe alſo to proue prayer for the dead.</p>
                  <p>For the iuſtification of their doctrine concerning the worſhip of ſaints and their images, they tell lies of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges mouing, talking, working, walking, and of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full apparitions and miracles done by them. Our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies image is ſaid to ſpeake to <hi>Hiaciullyus. Goodrike</hi> ſaw a boy come out of a crucifixes mouth, as <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth.</p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:18556:190"/>
                  <p>Finally, the Popes and their agents, without lies and notorious forgeries cannot maintaine their cauſe: as by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite lies of <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius, Parſons,</hi> yea and of the Popes themſelues I haue iuſtified. Doeth it not then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,<note place="margin">In the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.</note> that in lying they haue ſet vp their reſt? And will not the world ſee the abominations of popery, that cannot be maintained but by lying, forgery and force? God graunt that truth may once appeare, and open the eyes of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that they may ſée that which now lieth hidden, and come to the perfect knowledge of truth.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the former anſwer could be finiſhed and publiſhed, there came to my hands foure other bookes, all penned by our mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aduerſaries, and ſent ouer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Rome</hi> and other places into <hi>England,</hi> to diſturne ſimple people from the loue of the truth: of which I haue thought good (moſt Chriſtian Reader) here at the end of this work briefly to aduertiſe thée. I hope alſo, that the ſame aduertiſement wil ſerue for preſent ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thoſe which percaſe expect a ſpéedie anſwer to ſuch haſtie calumniations, and moſt wicked libels.</p>
            <p>The firſt is ſet out vnder the name of <hi>T. F. <hi>alias</hi> Thomas Fitzherbert,</hi> a man euill reported of by his owne conſorts; and therefore no maruell if hatefull to all men wel affected to their prince and countrey. Long he hath bene a ſpie, and penſioner of the king of <hi>Spaine.</hi> But now perceiuing belike that the trade is become odious, &amp; groweth out of requeſt, he is turned Maſſe prieſt, and ſet to ſing for the ſoules of his friends, after thrée farthings a Maſſe. And leaſt he might forget his old art of ſpiery, he is now ſet to ſpy for his holy father, if by any good aduenture he can ſée Chriſts true body lurking vnder the accidents of the Maſſe-cake, his bloud by a neceſſary concomitance, as they ſay, being not farre off. This fellow as a Maſſe-prieſt was thought a fit perſon to ſpeake for the Maſſe, and as a ſpie and renegate Engliſhma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake ſhame of his country, and to defend traitors. And
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:18556:191"/> yet the poore man is as fit to diſpute of the maſſing religion and popiſh ſubtilties, as an aſſe to play an antheme vpon a paire of organs. The true author of the booke, as his ſtile declareth, and the dealers in the edition muſt néeds witnes, is <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> an old hackſter in miſſifical quarels, and a great dealer in matter of conuerſion of <hi>England,</hi> and one that vſeth at his pleaſure to borrow other mens names, now calling himſelfe Captaine <hi>Cowbucke,</hi> now <hi>Dolman,</hi> now <hi>Iohn Houlet,</hi> now <hi>N.D.</hi> or Noddy, now <hi>T.F.</hi> or <hi>Tom Fop,</hi> now <hi>Robert Parſons.</hi> Vnder the name of <hi>Dolman</hi> he ſet out his traitorous &amp; ſeditious booke of ſucceſſion, in diſgrace of the Kings title. Vnder the name of <hi>Iohn Houlet</hi> he publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed certaine idle <hi>reaſons of refuſall:</hi> himſelfe neuer refuſing to attempt any miſchiefe againſt the State. Vnder the title of <hi>N. D.</hi> he ſet out his <hi>VVardword</hi> and <hi>VVarneword,</hi> ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing his manſhip with the perpetual note of a Noddy, implied by thoſe two letters <hi>N. D.</hi> And this courſe he tooke in <hi>T.F.</hi> his Apologie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is entitled <hi>A treatiſe of three conuerſions of England:</hi> and was ſet out by <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> alſo vnder the old ſtampe of <hi>N. D.</hi> whoſe ſignification euery child now knoweth to be Noddy. But why he ſhould write of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of his countrey to religion, we can ſée no reaſon, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we haue knowne him alwaies more ſtudious of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, then of the conuerſion of <hi>England,</hi> and his conſorts the Maſſe prieſts do teſtifie that he is a Machiauelian pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fellow, voyd of religion and honeſty. The turnings of the Maſſe, or turning of iackets, had bene a more fit ſubiect for him to handle, ſeeing he turneth &amp; ſkippeth ſo oft about the altar, like an ape dauncing about a maypole, and hath turned his coate ſo often from <hi>Engliſh</hi> to <hi>Romiſh,</hi> from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> to <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> from all to <hi>French,</hi> that ſome of his friends feare, vnleſſe he turne Cardinall, that he will turne <hi>Turke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is called <hi>A Suruey of the new religion:</hi> and was deuiſed by a renegued fugitiue Engliſhman, who hath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed diuers other countries, and yet neuer found any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in his braine or habitation. Like <hi>Caine</hi> he hath bin
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:18556:191"/> long a vagrant fugitiue fellow: <hi>Vagus &amp; profugus in terra:</hi> and ſéeketh, if not to kill, yet to ſlander his countrimen and friends, imputing vnto them moſt horrible opinions and crimes. It reſteth then, that we ſet vpon him a mark as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Caine,</hi> that euery man may know him for a ſuppoſt of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: although herein we néed not much to trauell, ſeeing the firſt letter of <hi>Kelliſons</hi> name, who fathereth this monſtrous moonecalfe, is K. and the man is noted among his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a great quareller about his commons. The poore fellow is but a kettle doctor, or rather a Tinker of broken ſchoole diſtinctions, and a profeſſor rather then a performer of any diuine learning. The fellow talketh idly of <hi>new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> but neither doeth he know what is new, nor what is old, nor what belongeth to religion, that taketh popery for religion, and eſtéemeth the maſſe and decretaliue doctrine, which this Church of <hi>England</hi> refuſeth, to be auncient: and the apoſtolike faith which we profeſſe, to be new.</p>
            <p>The fourth is termed <hi>A briefe and cleare confutation of a new, vaine, and vanting challenge:</hi> and is directed againſt a treatiſe ſet out ſome two or thrée yeares agone by mee; wherein is proued, that the Maſſe-prieſts and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are neither Catholikes nor good Chriſtians. But ſo learnedly and wiſely hath the author of this braggard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation handled the matter, that his good friends are ſory to ſée ſo worthy a worke miſnamed. For if he had done me right, he ſhould haue called his pamphlet <hi>A confirmation of my challenge,</hi> for ſo in truth it is, the author anſwering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, and rather by ſilence conſenting, then by good anſwering contradicting our arguments. The moſt of his diſcourſe ſtandeth vpon bitter railing, vaine talking, and childiſh trifling about ſerious matters. If any man doubted whether popery were hereſie before, I doubt not but that this weake diſcourſe, that yéeldeth no ſatiſfaction to any indifferent Reader may reſolue him. The author of this deuiſe, as we are credibly informed, is <hi>VValpoole,</hi> the ruler of the kitchin or porredge pot of the colledge of yong Engliſh popiſh traitors in <hi>Rome.</hi> In Italian they call him
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:18556:192"/> 
               <hi>Padre miniſtro,</hi> or <hi>padre de mineſtra,</hi> or Lord chiefe ſteward of the ſchollers porredge. The ſame man is that <hi>Walpoole</hi> that gaue poyſon to <hi>Squire,</hi> and corrupted him by promiſes of great rewards, both in this life and the life to come, if he would vndertake to empoyſon Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> &amp; the late Earle of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> and hauing gained a promiſe at his hands, ſwore him vpon the ſacrament to performe the ſame. The fellow is recorded in publike act bookes for theſe infamous ſtratagems, and knowne to be a notorious traitor and an atheiſt. We are not therfore much to maruell, if this wicked Iebuſites libel be ful of bitternes, atheiſme and poiſon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding from ſo impious an atheiſt, and ſo cunning a maſter in the art of empoiſoning. If any thing wanted in <hi>Walpool,</hi> whoſe wits are groſſe &amp; muddy, like a ſtanding poole or ſink of villany: yet was the ſame bountifully ſupplied by <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> the Rector of the quire of Romiſh conſpirators. You may then imagine what a loade of leaſings, calumniations and fooleries ſuch two coach horſes were able to draw out of their miry inuentions. Much are the ſimple papiſts to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, that liſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch wicked traitors, and ſuffer themſelues to be abuſed by ſuch notorious and infamous impoſtors.</p>
            <p>Vnto all theſe libels there are ſeueral anſwers in making. If they be not preſently anſwered, maruel not. They are of too large a blocke to be read ouer haſtily. My countrimen thinke, if the whole impreſſions of theſe foure books might be had, that they would wel ſerue to paue <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> cauſy. There would onely be this difference, that for cobble ſtones and rough ſlates, we ſhould haue cobbled bookes and rough hewne libels, as fit to be troden vpon as read ouer. Others think, becauſe they are in forme octagonall, and for the moſt part as thick as long made like brick-bats, that they would finely ſerue, ſéeing the holy father is ſaid to be the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Pope holy church, to lay vpon him, for the rearing vp of the wals of ſome Romiſh ſynagogue: &amp; ſo it wold be, like foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like wals. As ſoone as ſuch huge &amp; thick volumes may be run ouer, they ſhall God willing receiue an anſwer fitting ſuch indiabolated authors, and ſuch wicked &amp; railing ſtuffe.</p>
            <pb n="367" facs="tcp:18556:192"/>
            <p>In the meane while receiue this cenſure of them al. Firſt <hi>they are ſuch as need no long coargutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is a ſufficient courſe of conuiction of them to declare their perfidious falſhood.</hi> So writeth <hi>Hierome</hi> in an epiſtle to <hi>Marcella</hi> of like ſtuffe. <hi>Haec ſunt, quae coargutione non indigent: perfidiam eorum expoſuiſſe, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraſſe eſt.</hi> Big they looke, if we reſpect the bulk: but nothing is more friuolous, if we reſpect the matter. Out of great heapes of chaffe, there is no corne to be gathered: neither can we expect better ſubſtance out of theſe fardles of waſt paper, which like chaffe may be blowne away with any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle blaſt of reaſon and diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>All of them are of like argument, and for the moſt part repeate the ſame things. <hi>Parſons</hi> he playeth the part of that friuolous pleader, of whom <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh in his <hi>86.</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle. <hi>Eadem atque eadem ſaepe dicit, non aliud inueniendo quod di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, niſi quod inaniter, &amp; ad rem non pertinens dicit. <hi>He inculcateth the ſame things often, finding nothing elſe to ſay, but that he repeateth matters vainely, and which are not to the purpoſe.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The authors ſpread abroade ſhamefull rumors againſt moſt honeſt and innocent men, and that which procéeded firſt from themſelues, they pretend to haue heard of others, being themſelues both the authors and amplifiers of thoſe rumors. Such fellowes <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Furia <hi>de vid. ſeruand.</hi>
               </hi> doth rightly deſcribe. <hi>Hi rumores turpiſſimos ſerunt</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>&amp; quod ab ipſis egreſſum eſt, id ab alijs ſe audiſſe ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, ijdem authores &amp; exaggeratores.</hi> The Papiſts giue out moſt ſhameful reports of <hi>Luther, Caluin, Beza.</hi> nay of kings and princes. Afterward, they cauſe ſuch ſycophants as <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecus, Staphilus, Cochleus, Sanders, Ribadineira,</hi> and ſuch lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical barking helhounds to write them: and ſo euery odde companion taketh hint from them, &amp; in time the reſt ſhame not to diuulge and increaſe theſe leud reports themſelues.</p>
            <p>The moſt of the witneſſes alleaged by theſe fellowes, are men ſuborned by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Such are thoſe which already I mentioned. Such is <hi>Surius,</hi> and ſuch is that cogging and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing writer of legends and lyes <hi>Caeſar Baronius</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes. <gap reason="foreign" extent="2 words">

            <p>In ſumme, look how broad, thick and long theſe libels are; ſo full are they of villany, lies &amp; fooleries.

               </hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ad cauſam quam ſuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit nihil valentia.</hi> Such are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtimonies of our aduerſaries: their arguments are much worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>T.F.</hi> or rather <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> enfrocked in that aſſes ſkin, in his apology or poore defence for the cacolike cauſe, talketh much of the conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our country. But yet hath nothing which is not tediouſly repeated in the treatiſe <hi>of three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions,</hi> of which you ſhall heare anon an equall cenſure. In the meane while, I thinke him an vnfit man to talke of conuerſions to religion, that is but newly turned from a ſpy to a ſpider-catching Maſſe-prieſt.</p>
            <p>He bringeth ſome reaſons to proue the ſacrifice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſſe. But all his arguments are but fragments and teſtimonies borowed by reuerſion from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whoſe bookes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to his Cardinals hat, reſt refuted in my bookes <hi>De miſſa,</hi> and are yet left bare and without defence.</p>
            <pb n="369" facs="tcp:18556:193"/>
            <p>To talk of the antiquitie of Romiſh religion <hi>T.F.</hi> had litle reaſon, hauing as yet ſcarce learned to ſay maſſe, and being nothing elſe but a poore nouice in Romiſh religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; no way read in Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories, and incapable of ſchoole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties. Nay <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> ſhall haue much ado to anſwer our proofes, by which the Romiſh religion ſtandeth conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of nouelties.</p>
            <p>Gladly would he defend traitors, &amp; diſgrace good ſubiects. But therein the author declareth himſelfe rather a traitor, then a good ſubiect. If it be no treaſon to flie to forreine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to conſpire with them againſt their Prince and countrey: he muſt make other lawes, and not onely alter treaſon, but common reaſon alſo.</p>
            <p>Very bitterly he inueyeth againſt rack-maſters, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the cauſe of <hi>Squire.</hi> But what if <hi>Squire</hi> were neuer ſhewed the racke? Doth he not rack his conſcience to write ſuch notorious lies? The fellowes cauſe with his fooliſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions cannot be cleared. Nor with all his eloquence ſhall he be able to purge <hi>Walpoole</hi> charged to be the contriuer of that horrible treaſon, which <hi>Squire</hi> intended for the empoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of our late dread ſoueraigne. He was conuicted by his owne confeſſion, by a ſufficient witneſſe, by letters ſent out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and deuiſed by the conſent of <hi>VValpoole</hi> to bring <hi>D. Bagſhaw</hi> within the compaſſe of that foule treaſon. Matters ſo plaine, that euen the papiſts the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame, and are much aſhamed in the behalf of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole</hi> and his conſorts. It is ſayd, that <hi>Squire</hi> retracted his confeſſion concerning the accuſation of <hi>Walpoole.</hi> But the truth is, he neuer had any thought of any ſuch matter. Only he ſaid, that he neuer intended to put the treaſon in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which notwithſtanding before he had confeſſed.</p>
            <p>Finally, his diſcourſe is ſo wiſe, that vnleſſe we beléeue him on his owne bare word, and take publike records, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, depoſitions of witneſſes, and ſentences of Iudges to be may-games, and ſuppoſe that <hi>Squire</hi> was hanged in ſport: we cannot chooſe but condemne both <hi>Walpoole</hi> and <hi>Parſons,</hi> and all their adherents in this buſineſſe, to be both
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:18556:194"/> traitors and empoyſoners.</p>
            <p>The treatiſe of thrée conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s is deuided into two parts. The ſumme and ſcope of the firſt is compriſed in theſe few words: <hi>England hath bin thriſe conuerted to Chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by preachers ſent from Rome: <hi>ergo</hi> England is to ſubmit it ſelfe to the Pope, and to accept of that religion which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth vnto vs.</hi> This <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> doth ſuppoſe to be a good conſequence. For elſe he ſhould but trifle in his whole diſcourſe, and then eſpecially where he talketh <hi>of our obligation to the ſea of Rome,</hi> &amp; of <hi>S. Peters</hi> chaire. Neither doeth he doubt but to proue his triple conuerſion, and that in honor of the Popes triple crowne. But if we do well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his grounds and allegations, we ſhall find, that vnder the title of <hi>S. Peters chaire,</hi> and apoſtolical doctrine, the man doth ſéek nothing elſe but to recommend vnto vs the Popes cloſe ſtoole, with a decoction of his decretaliue doctrine, and moſt beaſtly abominations.</p>
            <p>The grounds of the whole diſcourſe are falſe, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made out of them, moſt weake and euil concluding. Firſt, moſt falſe it is that <hi>Britannie,</hi> or as <hi>Parſons</hi> ſayth <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> was thriſe conuerted by preachers ſent from <hi>Rome.</hi> Of <hi>Peters</hi> preaching in <hi>Britaine,</hi> whereupon the firſt ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed conuerſion ſtandeth, the obliuious fellow is but lately aduiſed. For in his <hi>Wardword,</hi> wherein he maketh the beſt ward for <hi>Rome</hi> that he can, he could not find any more then two conuerſions: and thoſe he rather fancieth then proueth. His proofes for <hi>S. Peters</hi> preaching in <hi>England,</hi> ſtand wholy vpon the teſtimony of <hi>Simeon Metaphraſtes,</hi> a lying pedant full of fabulous narrations, whereto the aduerſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues make conſcience to giue credit: of <hi>Surius</hi> a <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Monke, and a great eater of ſtockfiſh, and a codſhead para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite hired to ſpeak for the Pope: and vpon a forged lying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal ſet out vnder the name of <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt, wherein notwithſtanding we reade nothing ſpecially of <hi>Britaines</hi> conuerſion.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that were ſent from <hi>Eleutherus</hi> biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Chriſtian King <hi>Lucius</hi> of <hi>Britannie,</hi> ſéeme rather to haue
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:18556:194"/> bin <hi>Britans</hi> then <hi>Romanes,</hi> as the names of them ſet downe by <hi>Galfridus,</hi> by <hi>Caius,</hi> and other writers of Britiſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do report. <hi>Lucius</hi> certes had no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to craue baptiſme at the hands of <hi>Eleutherus</hi> his mandataries, vnleſſe he had bin well inſtructed in Chriſtian religion before. Beſide that the <hi>Romanes</hi> in theſe times ruling in moſt part of <hi>Britaine,</hi> it may be a queſtion, how far the kingdome of <hi>Lucius</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelfe. Suppoſe then that this hiſtorie is authentical, which may well be doubted, the ſame being onely found in legends and fabulous writers, all the glory of this conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt néedes ſtand vpon weake ſurmiſes and fabulous legends.</p>
            <p>As for the Monke <hi>Auſtine,</hi> he could not ſpeake one <hi>Saxon</hi> or <hi>Britiſh</hi> word, but was faine to bring interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with him out of <hi>France,</hi> then called <hi>Gallia.</hi> How then could he conuert them, which vnderſtood not one word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him? We do not reade, that he preached to the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>Britans,</hi> but only that he baptized. And very likely it is that he holp onely to baptize thoſe, whom either the <hi>Britans</hi> alwayes remaining among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and ſubmitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vnto them, or the interpreters, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> brought with him from <hi>Gallia,</hi> which then had a tongue common to both <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Britons,</hi> had before conuerted. But ſuppoſe that either himſelfe ſpeaking <hi>Britiſh</hi> or <hi>Saxon,</hi> or by ſome interpreter, ſhould haue conuerted ſome few: yet all that amounteth to nothing, and is ſcarce worth the ſpeaking of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe ſome <hi>Britans</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> had bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to Chriſtian Religion by preachers ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> in auncient time, when religion was pure and ſincere: yet <hi>Parſons</hi> hath no reaſon to make any great clamor vpon ſo ſmall aduantage. For firſt, all thoſe that are conuerted to religion, are not to ſubiect themſelues to thoſe churches fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence thoſe came that did conuert the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or elſe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhops that ſent them. The church of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledgeth no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or to the Biſhop thereof. Neither doth <hi>Friſeland</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> that was conuerted by
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:18556:195"/> 
               <hi>Saxons</hi> that came out of <hi>England,</hi> acknowledge our Church or Biſhops to be their ſuperiors. But were <hi>Rome</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> from whence her firſt preachers came; yet do not the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> now turne <hi>Turkes,</hi> becauſe <hi>Turkes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Suppoſe then we were beholding to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Romanes;</hi> yet what is that to Antichriſtian <hi>Romanes,</hi> that haue declined almoſt into as groſſe impieties as <hi>Turks,</hi> and worſhip idols, or as they call them images, ſo groſſely, that the <hi>Turkes</hi> do condemne them, and may iuſtly riſe vp too againſt them in iudgement. Againe, ſuppoſe we had bene beholding to the auncient <hi>Romanes,</hi> yet this maketh nothing for the moderne inhabitants of <hi>Rome,</hi> that either are a race of <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> that were enemies to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> or elſe a collection and Ramaſſe of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nothing like to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Finally, if we ought to embrace that religion, that was either taught by <hi>S. Peter, Eleutherus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or by other Chriſtian Biſhops in their times; then are we to renounce the decretaliue doctrine of Popes, together with the philoſophicall mixtures of ſchoole diuines, both which haue bin brought into the Church long after the ages wherein they liued. Furthermore, the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous worſhip of the croſſe with <hi>latria,</hi> of the ſaints with <hi>dulia,</hi> of the bleſſed virgine with <hi>hyperdulia,</hi> the doctrine of Papiſts concerning the carnall eating of Chriſts bodie, tranſſubſtantion, halfe Communions, priuate Maſſes, reſeruation of the Sacrament, purgatorie for temporall paines after the guilt remitted, popiſh indulgences and other popiſh traſh might be packing. It would alſo be time for the Pope with his triple crowne, two ſwords, guard of Suizzers, Cardinals, Monkes, Maſſe-prieſts, and Friers, to truſſe vppe his trinkets, and to make himſelfe readie for his iourney into ſome farre countrey beyond all Chriſtianitie. For neuer ſhall <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> proue, albeit he could conuert him ſelfe into all ſhapes, that <hi>Britaine</hi> was conuerted to any ſuch religion as this, or that the Church then had ſuch a forme, as now wée ſee in <hi>Rome.</hi> Page <hi>103.</hi> hée alleageth two proofes,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:18556:195"/> whereof the firſt he calleth negatiue, the ſecond affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and thereby hopeth to ſhew, that the moderne <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion is all one with the auncient Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But his negatiue ridiculous proofe is denied. His affirmatiue is rather a bare affirmation then a proofe. For firſt againſt his negatiue we offer to proue, that not onely the points of Romiſh doctrine, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> refuſeth, are brought in long after the Apoſtles time, but alſo that they are contrary to the Apoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But ſuppoſe we knew no originall of ſome of the Romiſh hereſies, are they therefore no hereſies? Is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try no idolatry, becauſe the firſt beginning thereof is not knowne? Or are the <hi>Angelikes, Archontikes, Croſſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Nudipedals, Monothelites,</hi> and diuers other heretikes true Catholikes, becauſe the Papiſts cannot ſhew who firſt broached theſe hereſies? Secondly, albeit the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgians,</hi> and ſome other learned men, find fault with ſome termes vſed by the fathers, <hi>as of ſacrifice, altar, prieſt, purgatorie, free-will,</hi> and ſome other: yet that ſheweth not, either that all the fathers vſed theſe termes, or that any of thoſe that vſed them, conſented with the Papiſts, which from new termes are growne to new and ſtrange doctrine. Beſide that, <hi>Parſons</hi> diſputeth ridiculouſly, which aſcribeth the particular and priuate opinions or ſome one or few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, to the whole Church. He himſelfe, albeit he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme many things deſperately, will not yéeld vs this point againſt his owne conſorts. So we ſée <hi>Parſons</hi> his whole <hi>treatiſe of three conuerſions,</hi> eaſily ſubuerted in thrée words, and with the turning of a hand.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of <hi>Parſons</hi> his treatiſe, wherein he pretendeth <hi>to make ſearch for the religion profeſſed in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> is wholly without the compaſſe of his title of thrée conuerſions. So ſimple was he in his choiſe, that he could not chooſe a title to fit his fantaſticall worke. Beſide that, he ſeemeth to be blind that could not find our Religion in the auncient Church of Chriſt for a thouſand yeares after Chriſt, and long after. For there is no point or article
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:18556:196"/> of faith taught by the Apoſtles, &amp; receiued by the conſent of the whole Church in any auncient and lawfull Councell, but we receiue it and embrace it. Nor do we profeſſe any thing in the Creed of the Apoſtles, or of the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther auncient Councels, which the auncient fathers did not alſo together with vs receiue and profeſſe. While therefore the light-headed frier ranne poaſting through all ages, and pretended to enquire for newes of our Church, which he might ſée if he would, in all places: he reſembleth much that wiſe fellow, that could not ſee wood for trées. Neither is it material that in auncient time he findeth no oppoſition made againſt the Popes primacy, or vniuerſall power, or to the Maſſe, or to the doctrine of tranſſubſtantiation, the carnall preſence in the Euchariſt, the ſacrifice of the maſſe, the <hi>7.</hi> ſacraments, purgatory, indulgences, &amp; ſuch like. For who ſeeth not, that it is moſt ridiculous to make ſearch for oppoſition againſt popiſh doctrine &amp; hereſie, before the ſame was extant in the world? But as ſoone as any began to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the name of <hi>Oecumenical, or vniuerſal Biſhop, Gregory</hi> the firſt challenged him for it, <hi>as the fore-runner of Antichriſt.</hi> The worſhip of images, allowed after a ſort in the ſecond Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> though not in ſuch groſſe maner as now, was oppugned in the Councell of <hi>Francford</hi> in the time of <hi>Charlemaine.</hi> The carnall preſence of Chriſts body in the ſacrament, was not beleeued by <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>7.</hi> as <hi>Beno</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, and was both the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and afterward diſliked by many. Tranſſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was diſputed againſt by the ſchoolmen. All the Eaſterne Church ſpurned againſt the Popes head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, his purgatory and indulgences. Neither ſince the time of the firſt beginning of theſe corruptions, did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Albigenſes, Valdenſes, Wiclephians,</hi> and <hi>Bohemians,</hi> as they are called, together with diuers others, ceaſe to exclaime againſt theſe popiſh abuſes. But (ſaith <hi>Parſons</hi>) theſe did not in all things agrée with vs. Yet if he ſpeake of matters of faith, he wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them and vs. If of ceremonies, it is not neceſſary that al churches ſhold agrée in all points. Furthermore, if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries had not calmniouſly layed diuers imputations of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:18556:196"/> hereſies vpon them, which they neuer held; the variation wold not haue ſéemed ſo great as they pretend. Wherfore if <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> ſéeke no better, it is not like that he wil find a Cardinals hat, which, as his friends charge him, he hath long ſought.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumme of that which is materiall in <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> his treatiſe of thrée conuerſions. The reſt is nothing elſe but froth of the mans fury and foolery, and containeth only certaine idle inuectiues againſt <hi>M. Fox,</hi> that good man, &amp; againſt <hi>M. Bale,</hi> &amp; other honeſt Chriſtians, together with certaine fond tales of king <hi>Alphreds</hi> dreames, &amp; <hi>S. Cutberts</hi> apparitions, &amp; ſuch like woodden &amp; popiſh ſtuffe drawne out of lying legends. He forgot not alſo to raile againſt our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Quéene lately deceaſed, and to call her <hi>old perſecutor,</hi> and to lay an aſperſion of ſlaunder vpon the State, as if the ſame did perſecute Papiſts for religion: a matter of which the ſecular Maſſe-prieſts are aſhamed, and ſticke not to cleare thoſe, whom this conuertible <hi>Proteus</hi> moſt vniuſtly chargeth. Finally, his fardle of waſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers containeth diuers corruptions and deprauations of holy Scriptures, miſſ-allegations of Fathers, weake col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, groſſe errors, rebellious poſitions, notorious lies and calumiations, which in a large treatiſe herafter are to be diſcouered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>K. Kelliſons Suruey,</hi> if any man liſt to ſuruey and peruſe a certaine ſlaunderous and railing companions libell, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Caluinoturciſmus,</hi> and with hatred more then <hi>Turkiſh</hi> to chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſet out by <hi>Gifford</hi> of <hi>Lile,</hi> wil be found to be wholy ſtolne out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, albeit he yéeldeth no thanks to thoſe from whence he borowed, or rather ſtole his inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Plagiary therefore néedeth no other anſwer, then that which is already made to <hi>Giffords</hi> Turky worke called <hi>Caluinoturciſmus.</hi> It ſéemeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man is at a ſtand. For albeit <hi>Gifford</hi> hate religion like a <hi>Turk,</hi> yet he anſwereth no more, then if by vertue of <hi>Parſons</hi> his thrée conuerſions, he were turned into a mute <hi>Turbot.</hi> This K. alſo of his owne hath added a glozing and flattering Epiſtle to the King,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:18556:197"/> a certaine preface concerning <hi>inanimate and vnreaſonable creatures,</hi> percaſe like the Arcadian beaſts of <hi>Doway,</hi> and certaine fragments &amp; old ends of diuers ſtale declamations, made (as it ſeemeth) at the drinking out of a pot of Reniſh wine. His ſchollers (I heare) gape and wonder at his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible eloquence. But yet the wiſeſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee, that they haue no affinitie with his purpoſe, and onely ſerue to fringe his chapters, like as muſtie ends of mockado ſerue to ſtitch his iacket of <hi>perpetuana.</hi> All the whole amounteth to nothing, ſaue to declare the man to be a perpetuall railer, and a moſt ſottiſh declaimer.</p>
            <p>The idle fellow in all his ſcuruy collection, which he like a ſurueyor without commiſſion hath made to litle purpoſe, doth neither ſhew wiſedome, nor modeſtie, nor learning. If the fellow had bene wiſe, he would not haue touched any matter of <hi>noueltie or abſurditie.</hi> For therein he giueth his aduerſaries iuſt occaſion, not onely to iuſtifie their religion to be moſt ancient and conſonant to holy ſcriptures, but alſo to declare his popiſh religion refuſed by vs, to be a packe of nouelties, and a maſſe of groſſe abſurdities. For who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that the Romiſh Church conſiſting of a triple-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and croſſe-ſlippard Pope, with his guard of <hi>Suizzers,</hi> a conſiſtory of purple Cardinals, that hath neare affinitie to the purple whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a rabble of rakehellike maſſe-prieſts, filthy monkes, friars, and nunnes, with a people worſhipping idols, and beléeuing the decretaliue doctrine of Popes, and the decrées of <hi>Trent</hi> is new, and neuer ſéene before vntill of late. Who doeth not vnderſtand, that both the grounds of popery, &amp; the doctrine thereon built is new? For neither can K. ſhew, that the auncient Church was founded vpon the Pope and his decretals, or vpon traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons allowed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that the Church was tied to ſuch ſenſes of ſcriptures, as the Romiſh Church alloweth, or bound to follow the old Latine tranſlation of the Bible. Neither can he proue, either out of fathers or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers, that Chriſts true body is both in heauen and earth, and in euery pixe at one and the ſame time, or that
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:18556:197"/> his body is inuiſible or impalpable, or that there are iuſt ſeuen ſacraments, and neither more nor leſſe, and that Chriſtians receiue Chriſts fleſh with their téeth and mouth, or that the Pope is the head and ſpouſe of the Church, or that he hath two ſwords, or that any images are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with latria, or that diuels torment ſoules in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or that the Popes indulgences deliuer ſoules fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe torments, or ſuch like points of popery.</p>
            <p>Now what I pray you is more abſurd, then to beléeue that a man can eate himſelf, as the Maſſe-prieſts ſay Chriſt did at his laſt Supper, nay that a dogge or a hogge can eate Chriſts body, or that a ſpider can be drowned in his bloud, which ſaueth all, deſtroyeth none, that can receiue it? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what is more ſenſeleſſe then to adore croſſes and dumbe images, which neither ſee, nor heare, nor moue, and whoſe honor is not ſéene or knowne of thoſe ſaints to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they belong, for ought we know? Thirdly, what is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient then to make a blind Pope, that is ignorant of all matters of religion for the moſt part, ſupreme iudge of controuerſies of religion? Can blind men iudge of colours, or ignorant atheiſts of religion? Fourthly, what is more blaſphemous then to teach, that the Scriptures to vs are not authenticall, vnleſſe the Pope conſigne them vnto vs? Shall not truth be truth, vnleſſe it pleaſe the Pope to ſay it? Finally, ſeeing faith ought to be moſt certaine, and built vpon grounds moſt certaine; the popiſh religion muſt néedes be an abſurd faith, and a falſe religion, that is built vpon traditions as well as Scriptures, of which traditions the papiſts can yéeld no certaine proofe, but are driuen to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage either lying legends, or old motheaten miſſals, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain cuſtomes. It were an eaſie thing to alleage infinite ſuch like abſurdities, of which this ſurueying K. hath very fooliſhly offered vs occaſion to diſcourſe at large.</p>
            <p>He doeth alſo very ſimply talke of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, <hi>Suruey li. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
               </hi> For if Papiſts ſay truly, that Chriſts body and blood is really offered in the Maſſe, and that euery externall ſacrifice requireth a reall deſtruction: then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,

               </hi> (ſayth) that an externall ſacrifice <hi>doth require a reall deſtruction. <hi>Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit realem deſtructionem.</hi>
               </hi> Was then this fellow wiſe trow you, to talke of this braue ſacrifice? Further do we thinke him wiſe, that in a booke offered to the king, doth rayle on the kings religion, ſaying, <hi>That it leadeth vnto atheiſme?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, it is a note of deſperate folly to affirme, <hi>That our religion leadeth to Atheiſme</hi> for want of a Pope, or <hi>for want of the Popiſh maſſe or ſacrifice.</hi> The contrary hereof rather is to be gathered againſt the Popiſh religion: wherein, as we may collect out of the aduerſaries owne confeſſion in <hi>c. ſi Papa dist. <hi>40.</hi>
               </hi> the Pope may lead with him thouſands of ſoules into hell. The maſſe alſo is a maſſe and ſinke of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and idolatry. Neither is any thing more repugnant to Chriſts only ſacrifice, then the prieſthood and ſacrifice of the maſſe.</p>
            <p>Modeſty he ſheweth none, with a face as hard as a lopſter, affirming, <hi>That we teach, that God is the author of ſin: That we deſpoyle Chriſt of his diuinitie. That we wrong him in his office of redemption, and bereaue him of his title of lawgiuer and prieſt: And doubt not to ſay, that Chriſt diſpaired.</hi> Now what greater impudency can be imagined, then to aſcribe that to vs, which we vtterly deny and diſclaime? Nay, we pronounce him accurſed, whoſoeuer ſhall hold any of theſe points. But the Papiſts in ſome things rub very néere vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe rocks, &amp; namely, where they giue to euery man power to ſatiſfie for the temporall paine of his ſins, and yéeld, that others beſide Chriſt may be called redéemers, and make the Pope <hi>a law-giuer, able to bind mens conſciences,</hi> and giue power to the prieſt to intercede for Chriſts body and blood, that God would be pleaſed to accept it, <hi>as he accepted the ſacrifice of Melchiſedech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Impudently alſo he belieth vs, &amp; raileth vpon vs, ſaying, <hi>that we make euery priuate mans ſpirit ſupreme iudge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies;</hi> and that we reiect Fathers &amp; auncient Councels, and ouerthrow all religion and worſhip of God.</p>
            <pb n="379" facs="tcp:18556:198"/>
            <p>Neither doth he onely raile vpon vs, but alſo vpon ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where he ſayth, <hi>that founding our ſelues only on ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we open a gate to all heretikes and hereſies.</hi> As if the Fathers and auncient Councels which founded their faith vpon holy ſcriptures only, opened a gap to all hereſies. Or as if this could be ſpoken without diſgrace to holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that he that relieth vpon the word of God deliuered in ſcriptures, doth open a gate to all hereſies.</p>
            <p>Finally, he taketh vpon him the title <hi>of the legate of the great monark of heauen;</hi> being but a baſe, fugitiue, renegued companion, ſet on by Antichriſt and his ſuppoſts, to raile at religion, and the profeſſors thereof, and lying without rule or order.</p>
            <p>His want of learning doeth euery where appeare throughout his whole Suruey. The Scriptures he citeth very rarely. The Fathers he miſtaketh and miſalleageth. In Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories he is but a nouice. Nay, albeit he talketh much of our Religion, yet he vnderſtandeth not what we profeſſe, what we reiect. Finally, although the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low be but a poore tranſlator and collector of other mens ſlanders, yet could he not well relate that which is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of others. His principal witneſſes are <hi>Staphilus, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chleus, Bolſer, Nicol Borne, Stapleton, Surius,</hi> and ſuch like railing and baſe authors. Was it then likely that he ſhould ſhew learning, that is wholly conuerſant in theſe trifling authors, deuoyd either of learning, or elſe of all religion and honeſtie?</p>
            <p>And all this, God willing, ſhall by many particulars be verified, by thoſe who already haue vndertaken to controle his Suruey, and to examine euery article of this leud li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell. Not that ſuch an aſſes head deſerueth any curious wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, but becauſe ſuch a barking cur dog would be ſilenced with a ſharpe cenſure.</p>
            <p>It reſteth now, that I ſpeak a word or two more of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool</hi> &amp; his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The man is a ſpecial friend of mine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very ſmal acquaintance: a cunning triacle ſeller al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tbank, &amp; a maſter empoiſoner, as before is declared.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:18556:199"/> This onely I forgot to tell you, that his braine is full of quickſiluer, his memory like an old leather budget, his crowne like the poſterior parts of an ape, and his head like the knop of the handle of a gittern with two ſtrings. If you méete any ſuch fellow in the kitchin of the Romiſh colledge of Engliſh boyes, commend vs to him, and tell him that we haue at leiſure peruſed his Mirificall confutation, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now he may beſtow it vpon the cook to ſtop his bottels. The ſtile biteth like pepper, and therfore may do ſome good ſeruice there. Onely thus much I muſt tel him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his words are too high for ſuch a low ſubiect as he handleth. Euery where he raileth like a man beſide himſelfe, and calleth me <hi>mad man, ſycophant, franticke fellow, lunatike, ſatanicall, iugling miniſter, dolt, foole, noddy foolman, irreligious atheiſt, ideot, aſſe, drowſie heretike,</hi> and ſuch like names, and theſe are the common flowers of his dogged eloquence. Yet I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, that I am not offended with his rough ſtile. For although he giue me very hard words, and raileth like a tal fellow of his tongue; yet I thanke him, he is well content to paſſe by all my arguments in ſober ſilence, &amp; to confirme as much as I affirme by his cold deniall. Now what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter argument, I pray you, can we bring to proue that <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole</hi> and his conſorts are neither Catholikes, nor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the true church, nor hold the ancient religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt Ieſus, but rather are a pack of heretikes, idolaters and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, then that our aduerſary, that taketh vpon him their defence, hath nothing to anſwer in their behalfe? It was not modeſty certes that made him ſilent, but méere imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his cauſe, and want of iuſt defence.</p>
            <p>Will it pleaſe you to take a taſt of his inſufficiency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we broach the whole barrell of his foolery. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his booke, he vanteth <hi>that he hath ſpent his time in exact ſtudie of Diuinitie, and with particular care read the Scriptures, Councels and Fathers.</hi> O happy youths, that heare ſo exact a ſpender of his time in ſtudy of Diuinity! O hard aduenture for vs, that are to encounter this giant, that hath deuoured ſo many Councels and Fathers!
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:18556:199"/> But in the meane while <hi>Parſons</hi> was much too blame, that put him to it thus impudently to praiſe himſelfe. We for our parts do admire his ſingular folly and arrogance, who praiſeth himſelfe with ſuch impudency. His great reading to vs is inuiſible, his great ignorance in all maner of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not onely in theology is euery where apparant.</p>
            <p>Fol. <hi>2.</hi> he telleth vs how <hi>Heraclitus</hi> affirmed <hi>that the ſnow was blacke.</hi> But vnleſſe he produce his author, his friends with <hi>Heraclitus</hi> may wéepe, to ſée his pittifull ignorance. We haue heard ſuch a thing of <hi>Anaxagoras:</hi> but this of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi> is ridiculouſly forged. In the ſame place he writeth alſo, how <hi>Zeno</hi> taught, <hi>That it was impoſſible for any thing to moue.</hi> A matter very ſtupendious. But this he findeth, that hath read exactly the fathers. Would he name his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, he will make a Stoicke to laugh.</p>
            <p>Fol. <hi>8.</hi> he ſayth, that <hi>Chriſts body hath a being in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like to a ſoule.</hi> But our Sauiour <hi>(Luke 24.)</hi> ſheweth a notorious difference betwixt a body and a ſpirit. Out of his reading of the fathers, he neuer learned that Chriſt had a body vnlike to ours.</p>
            <p>Fol. <hi>16.</hi> he compareth <hi>Chriſts</hi> body to God, <hi>that is in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places.</hi> A matter that tendeth to the deſtruction of the article of Chriſts incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and much repugnant to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and fathers. Vnto theſe words of <hi>Hilary, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de Trin.</hi> Of the truth of the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, there is no place of doubting left:</hi> he addeth diuers words, falſifying them in this ſort, <hi>Of the true preſence of the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt in the bleſſed ſacrament, there is no place of doubting left.</hi> Belike his great and exact ſtudy of diuinity, and particular care in reading, will beare him out in it. Yet <hi>Hilary</hi> talketh of <hi>Chriſts</hi> true incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not of the preſence of <hi>Chriſts</hi> body and bloud in the ſacrament.</p>
            <p>Fol. <hi>31.</hi> he ſayth, <hi>That our bodies are nouriſhed with the body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> But the holy fathers teach vs, that <hi>Chriſts body and blood is food for the ſoule, and not for the body. Cyprian <hi>De Coena Domini,</hi>
               </hi> ſayth, <hi>We ſharpe not our teeth to bite.</hi> And <hi>Auguſtine <hi>tractat.</hi> 26. <hi>in Ioan.</hi>
               </hi> ſayth,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:18556:200"/> 
               <hi>We are not to prepare our teeth,</hi> viz. when we receiue this holy ſacrament. Here therefore this fellow followed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> and not the fathers of the Church.</p>
            <p>Fol. <hi>174.</hi> he diſtinguiſheth <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> from <hi>Vermilio,</hi> whereas this is <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> ſurname. He telleth vs alſo that <hi>Flauianus</hi> taught, that <hi>God was the author of all ſinne.</hi> But if he produce not his author, it will be an eaſie matter to ſhew, that he belyeth <hi>Flauianus,</hi> and miſtaketh one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother through pitifull ignorance.</p>
            <p>To bely &amp; falſify the fathers with this baſtardly Iebuſit, is but a <hi>peccadillio.</hi> Fol. <hi>18.</hi> he auoucheth boldly, that <hi>Gregory ſpeaketh not of ſatisfying for the guilt, but for temporal paine.</hi> But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of <hi>Gregory</hi> do plainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince him of this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood. For in him theſe termes &amp; ſubtilties are not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</p>
            <p>Fol. <hi>23.</hi> he is very bold with <hi>Lactantius,</hi> &amp; maketh him to aſſigne thrée notes, <hi>by which heretikes may be diſcerned from true Chriſtians.</hi> But this is more then euer <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſpoke or thought. He doth alſo giue ſuſpition by his corrupt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, as if <hi>Lactantius</hi> had ſpoken of popiſh auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and penance theron enioyned, which was neuer the authors meaning.</p>
            <p>Fol. <hi>25.</hi> he writeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Cyprian demonſtrated Peter to be the head &amp; root of the church.</hi> Which if <hi>Walpool</hi> had had a true tong in his head, he wold neuer haue affirmed. Beſide that, what a ridiculous toy is it, to tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlate <hi>Peters</hi> prerogatiue to the Pope, that is liker to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Calipha</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> then to <hi>Peter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fol. <hi>27. 31.</hi> &amp; <hi>34.</hi> he corrupteth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> moſt groſly, making him in the firſt place to ſpeak of thoſe traditions of which he neuer thought, &amp; in the <hi>2.</hi> to maintaine the vniuerſal power of the Pope, which he neuer knew. In the third place where <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath <hi>imaginibus,</hi> he blotteth out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, &amp; putteth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word <hi>magia,</hi> leaſt he might ſeeme to ſpeak againſt images.</p>
            <p>Neither doth he onely bely the fathers, but his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries alſo. Fol. <hi>114.</hi> he ſayth that <hi>Aurifaber, Snepfius, Heſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Vergerius, Beza, Muſculus, Socinus, and other miniſters in this agree, that the auncient fathers are againſt them, and for the Papiſts.</hi> A matter neither agreed vppon by all,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:18556:200"/> nor in theſe termes confeſſed by any. As for <hi>Socinus,</hi> he was an Italian heretike, caſt out and condemned by our church. Why then is he ranked with honeſt men? Doth this ranke fellow in this multiformelie, think it reaſon to range toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men of ſuch diſformitie? In another place he affirmeth boldly, that <hi>Luther, Caluine, Peter Martyr, and Melancthon make God the author of ſinne:</hi> not conſidering, as it ſéemeth, what a ſinfull act it is to calumniate and bely honeſt men. That they are deſperatly belied, their words and writings, where they profeſſe and declare the contrary of this which <hi>Walpoole</hi> affirmeth, do manifeſtly demonſtrate. But this monſter hath filed his tongue to ſpeake vntruth.</p>
            <p>Fol. <hi>157.</hi> ſpeaking of popiſh <hi>purgatorie</hi> and <hi>limbus patrum</hi> he ſayth, <hi>they were taught by all antiquitie.</hi> A lie moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and which ſhal make him famous to all poſteritie. For neither is this word <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> nor the popiſh diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the parts of hell, nor the popiſh doctrine concerning <hi>Limbus patrum</hi> and purgatory, held by any one, much leſſe by all the ancient fathers. And thereon I ioyne iſſue with this diſioynted companion, requiring him to anſwer that which I haue written <hi>De Purgatorio,</hi> and <hi>contra limbum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum papiſticum</hi> to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Of his great ſkil in Latin, his words fol. <hi>57.</hi> b. wil giue te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. For there he hath <hi>Vnae eccleſiae ſole,</hi> for <hi>Vno eccleſiae ſole,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> hath, or at leaſt <hi>Vnius eccleſiae ſole,</hi> if hee would haue ſpoken in any congruity. Of his ſkil in the Gréeke, we find good proofe, fol. <hi>54.</hi> b. where in two words he maketh thrée faults. Firſt he deuideth this word <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and maketh it two words. Next he writeth <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: and thirdly, he putteth an accent of aſpiration in the midſt of a word. If he had bene put to vſe much Greeke, we ſhould haue had good ſtuffe, that find him ſo faulty in this only one Gréeke word.</p>
            <p>To conclude with our partie for this time: neither in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting againſt his aduerſary, nor in defending himſelfe, his conſorts &amp; his cauſe, doth he acquite himſelf in any tolerable ſort. Vnto me he obiecteth, <hi>that I vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not the ſtate of the queſtion.</hi> A matter ridiculous. For he himſelf cannot deny,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:18556:201"/> but I report the aduerſaries meaning and words truly. He chargeth me alſo with vntruths. Yet is it no vntruth that I ſay, <hi>that Stapleton denieth the ſcriptures to be the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of religion.</hi> For I cite his words truly. And euery man that readeth his booke, entitled <hi>Principia doctrinalia,</hi> ſhal find that ſcriptures are excluded out of the number of <hi>Principia doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia.</hi> With the like facility I ſhal cleare all the reſt of his fooliſh obiections.</p>
            <p>Where I bring many arguments, all concluding that papiſts are no true Catholikes, as maintaining rather par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular then catholike doctrine, this wiſe confuter, or rather confounder of himſelf, flieth out like a wild gooſe into a long diſcourſe of the name of Catholike, and the cauſes of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude of the Church, matters ſcarcely queſtioned betwixt vs. He doth alſo lode vs with ſacks of authorities of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, concerning the vniuerſality of the Church, which are not to the purpoſe. But in all this diſcourſe he doth not once attempt to anſwer any thing ſaid by vs. Likewiſe in the Challenge, wherein Papiſts are declared not to be the true Church, he flieth al encounter, like a fooliſh combatant figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with his owne ſhadow. And this we do not doubt but to declare ſhortly in a larger anſwer moſt fully.</p>
            <p>In the meane while thou maiſt eaſily perceiue the vanity, falſhood, forgery and inſufficient dealing of our aduerſaries. <hi>Parſons</hi> in his booke ſet out vnder the name of <hi>T.F.</hi> doth moſt groſly and impudently praiſe himſelfe. In his booke of thrée conuerſions, he citeth <hi>Ado Treuirenſis,</hi> for <hi>Ado Viennenſis,</hi> and often miſtaketh one for another. Both his and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faults I haue before briefly noted. The reſt if thou wilt haue patience with vs, God willing thou ſhalt receiue ſhortly. Now I could beſtow no more time in polling theſe Arcadian fellowes. The Lord, if it be his holy will, diſcouer all the impoſtures of hereticall Papiſts, and grant that the rayes of his moſt glorious Goſpell may ſhine in all mens hearts, to the vtter confuſion of the ſeate of Antichriſt, and the full eſtabliſhment of the kingdome of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
